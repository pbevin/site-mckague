<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=4 COLOR=#000000>
This page is brought to you in an effort to promote better understanding of the urban raccoon and its place in today's society. The urban raccoon is a much-misunderstood and maligned creature and we are endeavouring to help it regain and maintain its proper place in our neighbourhood. We trust it will be a learning experience for all as we discover many of the habits of this endearing animal. We have also provided a guide for identifying urban raccoons despite their excellent camouflage. Just click on the small picture to view the larger version.

			The urban raccoon has occasionally been forced to take advantage of man-made shelters when there is a shortage of trees and the grain has been removed from the fields. (It should be noted, however, that not a lot of grain has been removed lately from the particular area under discussion.) As can be seen in this photograph, peaceful co-existence is possible and often the raccoon is not even detected because of excellent protective colouration.</FONT>

			The urban raccoon is renowned for its ability to climb most obstacles. (Because of construction of storage sheds and garages within the environs of the identified habitat, we have heard a rumour that some local raccoons are currently in training  to leap tall buildings in a single bound. The number of them recently observed limping would seem to confirm the rumour.)</FONT>

			In recent years, it has become evident that the urban raccoon is able to develop friendships with domestic pets. It is heartwarming to see them sharing a late afternoon snack or playfully engaging in games of tag across the neighbourhood. Indeed, the domestic pets are responsible for much more noise pollution on these frolicsome occasions than the well-mannered raccoons.</FONT>
