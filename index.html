Welcome to <B><FONT SIZE="5">mckague.com</FONT></B>. Your hosts are <B>Linda McKague van Will</B> and <B>Carla McKague</B>.</P>
<P>
We want this site to be a resource for <STRONG>all</STRONG> of our family members, not just those named McKague. We welcome people named Wilson, McGregor, Richards, Osterhout, Clarke, or anything else--anybody whose family tree intersects with ours.</P>

<P>
To help you navigate around this site, we've chosen an image associated with each of the seven main families it deals with. When you see a link incorporating one of these images, you'll know quickly which family's photographs, family tree or other information it leads to. Here are the images we're using (at least for now--we may change our minds later):</P><BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>
March 2005:  Unfortunately, nothing. This site has not been updated since early 2004. Since then we have had time problems, and now have some major technical problems. We do have lots of new information, but we can't promise when it will be added. We'll keep plugging away, and hope it won't be much longer.</FONT></P>
