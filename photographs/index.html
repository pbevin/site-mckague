<P><FONT SIZE="4">We have lots of photographs, both old and current, that reflect our family. We're putting them up in various ways, as you will see below.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="4">To conserve on the time it takes these pages to load, most of the pictures are NOT in a form that will give you good results if you try to print them. If a few of them catch your fancy, let Linda know at the e-mail address on our main page, and she will be happy to send you files more suitable for printing (if she has them--some are just basically bad quality).</FONT></P><BR CLEAR=ALL>
