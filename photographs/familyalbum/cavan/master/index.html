<P>
<B>You will find <I>all</I> the County Cavan McKagues and descendants for whom we have posted pictures listed here. Just click on a name to see the pictures.</B></P>


<P>
Some names recur over and over for different people, so we've tried to make it a bit easier to tell them apart. For people who have died, we'll include any birth and/or death dates we have. We'll list people by nicknames as well as actual names, and by middle names if that's what they used. We'll identify which branch of the family they belong to. If you still can't sort them out, go and spend some time with our County Cavan family tree.</P>

<P>
Because the list is so long, we've subdivided it. Click on the appropriate letters below to get to the surname of your choice.</P><HR>
