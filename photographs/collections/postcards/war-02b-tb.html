So one day this ugly old wasp Austria, he bit the little butterfly and told her to go away or he would eat her up. The poor little butterfly couldn't go away so she had to fight the ugly old wasp. He hurt her and she cried and another butterfly who was bigger heard her. This other butterfly's name was Russia.</FONT>
