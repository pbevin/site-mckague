My children and grandchildren designed this page as a Father's Day surprise.  Now that the <A HREF="http://mckague.com">family web site</A> is up and running, we've moved it there, and I'll be updating it from time to time.

My name is <a href="eric2.jpg">Eric McKague</a>.  I have lived in the village of <A HREF="http://www.mckague.com/photographs/communities/castleton/">Castleton, Ontario</A> since
my retirement, and currently share my house with my daughter Linda. My
son Rick and his family also live here in town and my other daughter
Carla is in Toronto. Knowing where the grandchildren get to from time to
time gets a little more complicated. Ben has spent time in Indonesia
with Canada World Youth, Erica was in Thailand volunteering with the
Thai Status of Women organization and Menya used to be found almost
anywhere there was a ruin to be excavated. Jen plays piano and teaches
around the continent and Michelle is waiting to join all the adventures
one of these days.

Although the original McKagues who settled at Cherry Hill, near my
present home, were Irish immigrants, my children are fortunate in being
a  Scots/Irish/Welsh/Dutch/Amerindian combination and each successive
generation is becoming even more cosmopolitan, while retaining roots in
this part of the country.  I have three children (<a
href="carla.jpg">Carla</a>, <a href="linda.jpg">Linda</a> and <a
href="rick.jpg">Rick</a>), five grandchildren (<a
href="jen.jpg">Jennifer</a>, <a href="ben.jpg">Ben</a>, <a
href="menya.jpg">Menya</a>, <a href="erica.jpg">Erica</a> and <a
href="michelle.jpg">Michelle</a>) and -- at last count -- five
great-grandchildren (<a href="noah.jpg">Noah</a>, <a
href="emma.jpg">Emma</a>, <a href="graeme.jpg">Graeme</a>, <a href="hannah.jpg">Hannah</a> and <a
href="paul.jpg">Paul</a>).

I grew up at <A HREF="http://www.mckague.com/photographs/communities/longview/">Longview Farms</A>, near Castleton, with seven brothers
and sisters. The farm is still in the family after more than a century
and is now operated by my nephew Darcy as a thriving pork operation.
It's a little bigger now, things have modernized, and it is very
satisfying so see life go on there for another generation.  Originally
it was mixed farming there and some aspects of it changed very slowly
over the years.  Of the eight children in my family, five of us are
still alive and have a keen interest in our family history.  We live
close enough to get together for all important occasions, or sometimes
just to talk.

I spent many years as an executive with Canadian National Railways, and
since my retirement have finally had the time to golf (I got my first hole in one at age 88), play bridge and
garden, as well as to explore the
Internet and add to my collection of tiger-related material.  I was
widowed some years ago.  My wife, the former Margaret Lillian Richards
of<A HREF="http://www.mckague.com/photographs/communities/warkworth/"> Warkworth, Ontario</A>, was born just a few miles away. Her family, the
Richards and Wilsons, have lived in Northumberland County as long or
longer than mine. Her father and grandfather were both local doctors.
Both families attended the same high school in Warkworth. I was the
middle of three generations who attended the same one-roomed school -- a
far cry from the newer generations who have spread across the globe from
time to time.

After some minor experimentation with a VIC-20 in 1980, I didn't have
access to a computer until my daughter Carla gave me a Mac in 1993 (when
I was 83) and I have been a dedicated Mac user ever since.  Fortunately
most of my offspring feel the same way and we have e-mailed each other
from Britain to Thailand to the southern United States and back to rural
Ontario, Canada, where I live.  My father helped to start the first
telephone company in this area.  When he strung those first telephone
wires along the fenceline to my mother's family farm, I doubt he ever
imagined I would be able to communicate daily with grandchildren all
over the world.  Thanks to our Macs and modern technology, we manage to
communicate quickly and often during times of crisis or celebration.

My latest hobby is computer graphics. I love to produce what I call "sillypix", in which I play with pictures of family and friends. Have a look at some of them <A HREF="http://mckague.com/eric/sillypix/">here</A>.<BR>

Please feel free to <A HREF="mailto:eric@mckague.com">write me</A> if you
share my interests of golf, bridge or computers. I would really like to hear from other McKagues and McGregors out
there who are related.
