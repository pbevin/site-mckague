&quot;WHEN THE GUN WAS FIRED<BR>
&quot;Warkworth  May 24th, 1923<BR>
&quot;A SALUTE TO QUEEN VICTORIA<BR>
&quot;By Orval Kelly<BR>
     &quot;Time was when the 24th of May was referred to as the Queen's Birthday, in fond memory of that venerable monarch, Queen Victoria. It was traditionally the time when men shed their long woollen underwear and the picnic season was ushered in. But the holiday has had a long association with fireworks and firecrackers.<BR>
     &quot;Older Warkworth citizens will recall the occasion when a group of adults decided to salute the birthday of Queen Vic with a king-size bang. Early morning of May 24, 1923, these respected citizens were chatting at the main intersection. At that time a captured German trench mortar, a relic of World War One, stood in front of the Community Hall.<BR>
     &quot;Some one suggested it would be fun to fire the old weapon and really wake up the town. They did! A collection was hastily taken; one man was detailed to hunt up the hardware merchant and buy the powder. The postmaster procured a pile of old newspapers from his office. A couple of pounds of powder was poured down the muzzle, the paper was firmly tamped into place and a fuse inserted. Touching a match to the fuse, the gun crew took shelter behind the community hall to await developments. Said developments were far beyond their expectations.<BR>
     &quot;With a mighty roar the old gun leaped from its base, belching fire, smoke and fragments of coloured comics.  All the windows in the Community Hall, the telephone office and Joe Dixon's garage were shattered by the blast. Windows in stores and apartments up and down Front Street met a similar fate. Dogs which had been innocent onlookers fled for their lives.<BR>
     &quot;Residents of the area who had been sleeping in on this holiday morning jumped from their beds and dashed into the street to see what had happened. A heavy pall of smoke indicated the source of the explosions. Bits of coloured paper drifted down from the sky.<BR>
     &quot;Surveying the havoc, one citizen enquired from Artie Wilson as to who had been responsible for this outrage.<BR>
     &quot;Artie, who had bought the powder, replied: &quot;I don't know, but whoever they were, they were damn fools!&quot;<BR>
     &quot;A very subdued gun crew had to dig in their pockets again to pay for replacing the windows of those citizens who failed to consider it a joke, and sent in bills for damage. But they always maintained it was worth it.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C66">66</A></SUP><BR>
