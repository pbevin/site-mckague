Obituary, <U>The Amherst Island Beacon</U>, May 1997:<BR>
&quot;JOHN ROBERT ARTHUR McGINN<BR>
     &quot;Art McGinn was born to Marian Smith and Charles McGinn of Amherst Island in 1927, on the home farm at the west end of the island. He lived and worked there for many years, maintaining a Holstein dairy farm, shipping milk directly to the factory. His farm was important to him all his life. He brought his bride, Susan Grace Gibson to his home and stayed there until his death, April 21, 1997. Art's brothers and sisters were: Leona, Donald, Mavis, Brice, Annie, June and Johnny.<BR>
     &quot;Art started working with the R.E. Harding Roofers (later Amherst Roofing) about 1960, and worked with them, mainly as 'pot man' for about 20 years, until ill health forced him to retire. He and Hans de Haan used to travel quite a lot with the job, and one of his adventures earned him the nickname of 'Casper'. He was very conscientious about his work, and was often the first in line, waiting for the ferry, showing his determination never to be late.<BR>
    &quot;When he and Susan were married just after the war, times were very lean. They managed to travel to Bath by horse and cutter to be married and then went on to Napanee for their honeymoon, with $17 in their pockets.<BR>
     &quot;He was a very committed family man. He felt himself very fortunate that he and Susan were able to have a big family: William, Grace, Bonnie, Andy, Russell, Cheryl, Dale, Gail and Dan. Cheryl says that he taught the children their prayers, and that they would say them together, on their knees before bed, then line up to give their parents a hug and a kiss.<BR>
     &quot;Although he left school after grade 5, he continued learning through books and through life experience. His children feel he was always able to help them think through a problem and give them good practical advice and support.<BR>
     &quot;Art struggled with respiratory and circulatory problems for quite a few years. He died April 21st, 1997, in his 71st year.<BR>
     &quot;A great many people visited at the Paul Payne Funeral Home and attended the funeral there. He was buried at the Glenwood Cemetery on Amherst Island. He is greatly missed by his children and many grandchildren, and over 20 great-grandchildren. He will also be missed by his neighbours and friends.<BR>
   &quot;Donations to the Heart, Stroke and Lung Foundation in his name are gratefully accepted by the family.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C167">167</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Research Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#660000">MARRIAGE: The date of Art's marriage to Susan is given as &quot;just after the war&quot;.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C167">167</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
