Colborne Chronicle, May 14, 1998:<BR>
&quot;OBITUARY<BR>
&quot;John Clarence McKague<BR>
     &quot;Clarence McKague died quietly at The Golden Plough Lodge, Cobourg, April 8, 1998.<BR>
     &quot;Born on a farm in Cramahe Township September 25, 1908, he was eldest of eight children. He is predeceased by Wilfred and Ethel and survived by Eric and Jim of Castleton, Leila Kvistbo of Weston, Doris Rusk of Guelph and Florence Stephens of Peterborough, as well as numerous nieces and nephews.<BR>
     &quot;A school teacher, Clarence was proud of his rural roots. The family farm has been in his family for generations, and the tradition continues. His interests, extending to the wider community and its welfare, were guiding influences all his life.<BR>
     &quot;As a student, he attended Mount Pleasant Public School. Later, he and his brothers went by horse and cutter in winter, buggy in summer, to Warkworth Continuation School.<BR>
     &quot;After a year at Peterborough Normal School, he taught at Red Cloud School from 1926 to 1934, then later at Castleton Continuation School. When that school closed, he taught several years at Warkworth Continuation School. He next went to Brighton High School where he taught shop and history from 1954 until his retirement in 1966.<BR>
     &quot;As a teacher in 1933, he married his high school sweetheart, Helen Runnels.<BR>
     &quot;After a brief period in Oak Hills, they bought a house on Spring Street in Castleton where they lived until Helen's death in 1984.<BR>
     &quot;Clarence remained at the home until failing health saw him leave to live at The Golden Plough Lodge.<BR>
     &quot;At the Golden Plough, he maintained his interest and contact with the community and people to the best of his abilities. The community had been the centre of his life. His care and concern for others extended to include his caregivers at The Golden Plough Lodge for whom he had nothing but praise.<BR>
     &quot;Clarence's lifelong interests included active participation in Cramahe Baptist Church, planting trees, cutting grass, lighting the fire--doing whatever needed doing--until the church closed. He also had a real interest in Castleton United Church throughout his life. He was secretary-treasurer of the Castleton Cemetery Board from 1953-1992 and assisted ensuring assets provided would remain under the auspices of the municipality rather than the province.<BR>
     &quot;Clarence had a special interest in a children's camp which he helped with 'sweat equity' as well as financial donations.<BR>
     &quot;For some of his retirement years, he was a trustee on The Northumberland-Newcastle Board of Education.<BR>
     &quot;A favourite recreational pastime was planting trees and clearing brush on his tree far[m], a labour of love to restore the unused farm as an environmental contribution.<BR>
     &quot;Clarence's interests lay not in seeing the world but, rather, in relating in a personal way to his community and the people in it.<BR>
     &quot;He will be missed by the many whose lives he touched.<BR>

<BR>
Clarence sponsored the Castleton Public School Trophy for Mathematics. He left money to many charities.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C99">99</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
