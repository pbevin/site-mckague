He went to Grenfell SK in 1905 to work for his cousin William Staples, who dealt in horses and mediated between the Qu'Appelle Valley Indians and Europeans.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C27">27</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
He bought land at Saskatchewan NE 14-12-7 in 1906<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C68">68</A></SUP> <SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C27">27</A></SUP> at Winthorst,<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP> and broke 20 acres in 1906, 60 acres by 1908.  He sold this farm and went to Ontario in 1909; he returned with a boxcar of lumber and supplies.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C27">27</A></SUP>  Then on Oct 26, 1909<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C68">68</A></SUP> he bought NE 5-7-21-W2.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C27">27</A></SUP> <SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C69">69</A></SUP> He was living in residence by April 1, 1910.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP> The original farmhouse was built in 1910 for $300, and an addition was put on later as the children grew.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C41">41</A></SUP> Hedley broke 23 acres and cropped 15 in 1910, broke 47 acres and cropped 43 in 1911, and broke 40 acres and cropped 70 in 1912.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP> By 1912 he owned 5 horses and had two granaries, and had completed his homesteading requirements. He officially got ownership on March 5, 1913.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP> He combined horse power with his brother Arthur, whose land adjoined his, to plough the fields.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C27">27</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
See his brother Arthur's card for a vivid description of homesteading days.<BR>
<BR>
Memories from his daughter Dorothy Evans:<BR>
 &quot;John Diamond McGregor [father of Hedley's sister-in-law Lena McGregor] was the only granddad I ever had. He had a housekeeper, Miss Beck. Dad paid her to come and cook dinner and clean his shack because his girlfriend Florence stopped at Arthur's [after a trip with friends to Banff] and dad wanted to invite Art/Edith and her for dinner. Mother kept dad hopping. An open window and dad would say, 'Florence, do you need more tea?' When he wasn't looking she threw it out the open window (the tea--I mean). So, he'd make her more. Ain't love grand?<BR>
 &quot;In 1910, Dad's address was Key West, NWT. Sunday while the horses were resting, he walked to the Fred Farr home (about 6 miles) to pick up everyone's mail, if it was his turn to do so. That meant that someone else had to either walk or ride to the Key West Post Office (about 8 miles) and bring it to the Farr homestead.<BR>
 &quot;Dad was using the farming mill to clean his grain for seeding. After a storm one night, the granary was moved. Apparently the storm lifted it over his seeded trees and set it down on the prairie trail. The mill was standing in its same place and the cleaned cone of grain had not been disturbed.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Hedley brought seed from Ontario and planted a grove of trees. For many years the community homemakers had a summer picnic in the grove.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Hedley helped his brother Arthur organize the Lyons School<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP> (see Arthur's card).<BR>
<BR>
From 1928 to 1938 Hedley was a Councillor of Division No. 3, Norton Rural Municipality SK near Ogema.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C27">27</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
The family played a card game called &quot;Lost Heir&quot;. Every Sunday evening they had singing around the piano. On Saturdays, all the neighbours met in town and visited while they bought their groceries and hardware.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
&quot;With a stable behind they could spend a few winter months in town [Ogema, where Florence's brother had built them a retirement home]. Dad had checker tournaments both at the farm and in town. There were oyster suppers that followed. The drama club often practised in our town home. I can still remember the play 'Here Comes Charlie'.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP><BR>
 <BR>
Hedley curled, and his team won awards. It was renowned for pulling off an 8-ender.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Hedley lived in Ogema after Florence's death.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C6">6</A></SUP> In 1998, his family unveiled a cairn on his homestead, with 71 family members and close neighbours in attendance.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C70">70</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Bengough-Ogema Star, August 21, 1998:<BR>
&quot;McKague Family Honours Pioneer Parents<BR>
  &quot;Approximately seventy-five friends and neighbours joined the McKague family at the unveiling of a plaque honouring their pioneer parents, the late Hedley and Florence McKague on Friday, August 14th at the original McKague homestead located approximately eight to nine miles southeast of Ogema, NE 5-7-21 W2nd.<BR>
  &quot;Stuart McKague, son of the late Hedley McKague, gave the story of his father's journey west.<BR>
  &quot;James Hedley McKague purchased this homestead in 1910 after selling his homestead at Windthorst, Sask. He came to this homestead with three horses and a wagon. He built a shack and in 1918 married Florence Jane Stuart. The original house is still standing on this parcel of land.<BR>
  &quot;A family of four was raised on the farm: Dorothy, Stuart, and twins, Margaret and Marion.<BR>
  &quot;This farm is now farmed by third generation McKague's. Lonny is the owner. A tree was then planted by the three generations of McKague's: Stuart, Lonny and Taylor (Lonny's son).<BR>
  &quot;The unveiling was done by the children of the late James Hedley and Florence Janet [sic] McKague: Dorothy Evans, Stuart McKague, Margaret Buckler [sic], and Marion Buckler.<BR>
  &quot;The stone on which the plaque has been affixed was donated by Lonny's wife, Lucianne [sic] McKague. The plaque is inscribed:<BR>
  &quot;'James Hedley McKague (1882-1968) - Homestead 1910 NE 5-7-21 W2nd - Councillor Norton RM No. 69 - Married July 25, 1918 - Florence Janet [sic] Stuart (1887-1941) - Shared her talents. Dedicated 1998 by children, Dorothy, Stuart, Margaret and Marion.'<BR>
  &quot;Following the unveiling, twenty-two great grandchildren of the late Hedley and Florence McKague each took turns reading the history of the couple.<BR>
  &quot;Lunch, refreshments and socializing commemorating the memorable event was held for all in attendance back in Ogema at the home of Stuart and Donella McKague.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#990000"><B>Research Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#990000">NAME: His first name(s) is/are also given simply as Hedley<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C71">71</A></SUP> and as James.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C15">15</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
BIRTH: Hedley's birthdate is confirmed with no place given.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C65">65</A></SUP> He is shown as 8 in the 1891 census.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C15">15</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
DEATH: One source shows place and year;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C27">27</A></SUP> the other shows date only.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C65">65</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
MISC: One source<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C27">27</A></SUP> says Hedley returned from Ontario in 1910, but this does not correspond with the date of Oct 26, 1909 on the new land grant.<BR>
<BR>
Hedley's homesteading requirements were declared complete by the Dominion Land Office on Jan 14, 1913. Another stamp in Ottawa is dated Feb 7, 1913. The land was registered as his with the Registrar of the Land District of Assiniboia on Mar 5, 1913.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP><BR>
