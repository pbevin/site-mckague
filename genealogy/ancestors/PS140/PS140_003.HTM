&quot;With the Macedonian Dynasty (867-1025) Byzantium reached the height of its military power and cultural creativity. This period witnessed not only the expansion of the state beyond its old frontiers and the spread of Byzantine influence into the West and among the Slavs, but it also saw significant creativity at home, in art and architecture, literature, and learning. Much of this greatness was inspired by the last emperors of the Amorian dynasty, but it was given new and vigorous leadership by the dynasty founded by Basil the Macedonian. The greatness of this period should not be seen merely in the remarkable reversal of the empire's military fortunes, but also in its cultural explosion and the totally unexpected developments in art, architecture, and literature. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;A. The Origins of Basil I and his Rise to Power. <BR>
  &quot;1. Basil's family had been moved from Armenia and settled in the theme of Macedonia. (Hence, the Macedonian dynasty was not really 'Macedonian.') <BR>
  &quot;2. As a young man Basil was attractive and talented and he won a position at court, in part because he was able to defeat foreign champions in contests of wrestling. <BR>
  &quot;3. He soon became the trusted favorite of Michael III and began to plot against the Caesar Bardas, who was his main rival. <BR>
  &quot;4. In 865 Basil killed Bardas while the latter was enthroned beside his nephew. <BR>
  &quot;5. Basil was made co-emperor but be began to have even higher ambitions and to plot against Michael himself. <BR>
    &quot;a. Basil's wife was Eudokia Ingerina, the former mistress of Michael III. <BR>
    &quot;b. Michael finally became suspicous of Basil, but he was killed in his sleep in 867. <BR>
    &quot;c. The murder of Michael III, in which Basil was certainly implicated, was an embarassment for the Macedonian emperors' claim of legitimacy and it influenced all subsequent historiography: the Macedonian historians all had to explain why Basil 'had' to overthrow the corrupt Amorian dynasty, even though it was clear that this was an illegal act. <BR>
    &quot;d. Given the fact of Basil's usurpation of power, all this was perfectly normal and understandable, but it affected nearly every action of every member of the Macedonian dynasty. <BR>
&quot;B. The Reign of Basil I <BR>
  &quot;1. Basil's first concern was naturally to consolidate his power and secure recognition of his legitimacy. <BR>
    &quot;a. This concern for legitimacy was an overriding feature of the whole Macedonian dynasty. <BR>
    &quot;b. At the outset there was considerable support for Michael, especially among the soldiers. <BR>
    &quot;c. Basil sought to neutralize this by alliance with the zealots, who had been upset by the patriarchate of Photios. <BR>
    &quot;d. Photios was immediately deposed and Ignatius returned to the patriarchate (867). <BR>
    &quot;e. This was a purely political move, however, and Photius was soon employed as the tutor of Basil's children. <BR>
  &quot;2. In military affairs Basil attempted to equal the accomplishments of Michael III, but he fell considerably short. <BR>
    &quot;a. In Asia Minor the Paulicians, under the leadership of Chrysocheir, had become a military threat. <BR>
    &quot;b. The situation was saved by the destruction of Tephrice, the Paulician capital, by an earthquake and by timely victories of Basil's son-in-law Christopher. <BR>
    &quot;c. Basil's campaigns against the Arabs had little result. <BR>
    &quot;d. Basil directed considerable attention to Italy, where the Arabs had been largely unchecked for some time. <BR>
    &quot;e. Basil's best general was Nikephoros Phokas the elder. <BR>
  &quot;3. In religious affairs the primary issue was the allegi[a]nce of Bulgaria, which wavered between Byzantium and the papacy. <BR>
    &quot;a. Although Basil was willing to sacrifice Photios, a move which pleased the papacy, neith[e]r he nor Ignatios was willing to yield over Bulgaria. <BR>
    &quot;b. Bulgaria and the Bulgarian church remained firmly in the Byzantine sphere -- for which the pope condemned Ignatios. <BR>
    &quot;c. In 877, when Ignatius died, Photius again became patriarch. <BR>
  &quot;4. Despite his lowly origins and questionable rise to power, Basil appears to have been thoroughly grounded in the fundamentals of Roman law and Byzantine culture. <BR>
    &quot;a. He continued the cultural revival begun under the Amorian dynasty and he personally acted as a patron of the arts. <BR>
    &quot;b. After Justinian, he may be the greatest lawgiver of the Byzantine period: his works include the Procheiron and the Epanagoge.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C166">166</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
&quot;... c.813&ndash;886, Byzantine emperor (867&ndash;86). His ancestors probably were Armenians or Slavs who settled in Macedonia. He became (c.856) the favorite of Emperor Michael III. In 886, Basil, with the aid of Michael, assassinated Michael's uncle and chief minister, Bardas, and was made coemperor. Michael's feeling toward Basil began to change and in 867 Basil had him murdered and had himself proclaimed emperor. Thus the Macedonian dynasty of the East, which lasted until 1056, was founded. A capable ruler, Basil reformed the finances; modernized the law of Justinian I by introducing a new code, the Basilica; protected the poorer classes; and restored the military prestige of the empire. Byzantine art and architecture entered their second golden age during his rule. A major event of his reign was the dissension between the Roman and the Eastern churches. In order to prevent an open break, Basil restored (867) to the patriarchate Ignatius of Constantinople , who had been deposed in favor of Photius . On Ignatius' death, Basil reinstated (877) Photius, causing strained relations but not a full break with Rome. Basil in 865 had divorced his wife and married the mistress of Michael III. He was succeeded by his son Leo VI.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C167">167</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000f66"><B>Research Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000f66">CHILDREN: His children may not actually be his, but children of his wife's lover Michael the Phrygian (&quot;Michael the Drunkard&quot;), Emperor of the East,<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C168">168</A></SUP> whom Basil murdered in 867.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C169">169</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
