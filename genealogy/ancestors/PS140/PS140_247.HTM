He sent caravans to other cities to trade in the summer and winter. Her mother and father both died within 10 years of each other. Their wealth was divided amongst the children but it was Bibi Khadija who took over the family business and expanded it. With the profit she made she helped the poor, widows, orphans, sick and the disabled people of Makka. <BR>
  &quot;She had a cousin called Waraqa bin Naufal who was very learned man and who was not an idol worshipper. Both Waraqa and Bibi Khadija believed in one Allah. <BR>
  &quot;Becauise of her excellent Akhlaq the Arabs (who at that time used to look down upon women) called her Tahira - the pure one. She was also known as the 'princess of Makka' because of her wealth. A lot of Arab nobles and princess wanted to marry her but she refused all of them. <BR>
  &quot;In 595 AD, Bibi Khadija was looking for someone to be in charge of her caravan to Syria. Abu Talib suggested the Prophet to her. She had heard of his trustworthiness and agreed to employ him although he did not have much trading experience. To help him she sent her slave Maysara. The trading caravan was a great success and when Bibi Khadija heard of the Prophet's skills and excellent conduct, she became his admirer. <BR>
  &quot;Soon it was arranged for Bibi Khadija to be married to the Prophet (S.A.W). Abu Talib read the Nikah on behalf of the Prophet whilst Waqara read it for Bibi Khadija. Abu Talib paid the mehr for his nephew and fed the people of Makka for 3 days in celebration. Bibi Khadija too fed the people. The marriage was a very happy one and their first child was a son called Qasim. The second was Abdullah. Both died in infancy. Their third and last child was Bibi Fatema Zahra (A.S).<BR>
  &quot;When the Prophet used to go to meditate in the cave of Hira on Jabel An Noor, it was Bibi Khadija herself who would climb up there to give him his food and necesseries. Bibi Khadija was the first person to accept Islam as taught by the Prophet (S.A.W). <BR>
  &quot;In 616 AD, the Quraysh isolated the Bani Hashim (the family of the Prophet) and they took refuge in a ravine called Shib e' Abu Talib. Bibi Khadija was there too and it was her wealth (which she donated for Islam) that sustained the Muslims at that time. The siege lasted for 3 years during which time they experienced hunger, thirst, and the cold and heat of the desert. <BR>
  &quot;In 619 AD, Bibi Khadija died. When she died nothing was left of her wealth. Abu Talib died in this year too. The Prophet called the year Aamul Huzn (the year of grief).&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C175">175</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
&quot;While Bibi Khadija (a.s.) lived, the Holy Prophet (pbuh&amp;hf) did not marry another woman and in later years he always said that she was the best of his wives.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C174">174</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
&quot;She was a wealthy widow and the employer of Muhammad . After a successful business trip of Muhammad to Syria,  she sent her maid Nafisa to propose to him to be married. Muhammad accepted; she was forty and he was twenty-five. She was the mother of Fatima, the husband [sic] of Ali, the 4th Caliph. The marriage gave Muhammad prestige among the Quraysh, and also time to pursue spiritual contemplation. Muhammad remained faithful to Khadija as long as she lived. <BR>
  &quot;Their relationship also indicates that before Islam, (some) women were in control of their own lives, able to employ men and even propose marriage to man.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C172">172</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000f66"><B>Research Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000f66">BIRTH: She is said to have been 40 at her marriage to Muhammad,<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C178">178</A></SUP> which would make her birthdate ca 553.<BR>
