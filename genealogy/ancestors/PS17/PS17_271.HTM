    &quot;At this time the French were at war with the Indians in this Country. As fast as their soldiers were killed or died the ranks were filled with men from home. What was called conscripts or draftees were brought over as soldiers. My grandfather, John Richards, was one of the number called to leave Country, Family, and Friends to serve as a soldier. Being over eighteen years of age and a likely active young man, the Commanding Officer promoted him to a Lieutenancy in the army. The Sioux Indians were a very warlike race and gave them no end of trouble, and the country being all a wilderness gave the Indians much advantage, but the French by perseverance established themselves from the mouth of the St. Lawrence to the mouth of the Mississippi River. In an engagement my grandfather was wounded by a bullet in his thigh, was taken prisoner by the Indians.  He was placed with their other prisoners and when they halted, the Chief came to see them. He was accompanied by his daughter. The Chief had lost a son that day in the battle. A council was held to determine how to dispose of the prisoners and the young chieftainesse begged for Grandfather's life. The old Chief said it would only cause trouble, but the daughter pleaded for his life, saying she would cure him and adopt him in her dead brother's place, and her father consented. They extracted the shot but the ball he carried to his grave. For three years and over he was kept their prisoner.  He lived as they lived, learned three different Indian languages. During this time they had wandered far west, and at the end of three years began to talk of war. The head Chief called a Council of different tribes to consult on what was best to do. As the tribes came from different parts it was needful that a feast be made. So in order to do so they killed most of their dogs and for three days and nights held their feast before the Council was held. This feast was called a potlatch. For three days and nights they danced, sang, and ate. Of course after a time they became weary and one by one drunk and weary they lay down to sleep--all but one young squaw left to watch. They were all soon sound asleep and snoring away. My grandfather snored too but with one eye open. After a little, the squaw began to nod, till at last overcome by sleep she fell asleep.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C111">111</A></SUP> [Another version is that a pretty young Indian girl helped him steal a canoe, which he used to eventually get to Schoharie NY.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C117">117</A></SUP>]<BR>
     &quot;My grandfather said, 'Now or Never,' and very cautiously crawled out and fled. It was full moon in the month of June. He expected that the dogs they had left alive would give an alarm, but like their masters they were asleep. He ran as fast as he could but in a little while he heard the report of a gun. As soon as it came dawn he crawled into a hollow log. Expecting they would pursue him he lay there all day. At night he ventured out again. Weak and weary he still kept travelling on and on, living on green leaves, roots and such like. He had no guide but the sun, moon and starts [sic]. He knew that white people lived to the east so thither he bent his steps, not knowing how far it was but he kept on fording rivers and climbing over hills and mountains till at last he reached the settlement of Dutch people at Schoharie, N.Y. Then another difficulty presented itself. They spoke Dutch, and between French, Dutch and English he could not speak any correctly. He made himself partly understood. He found the people kind and sympathetic. He made his home among the British Colony. Among them he became acquainted with a widow named Wemp. She became his wife and in process of time they had a family of five children, three sons and two daughters--Owen R., the eldest, John R, Daniel R. The daughters, Jemima, the oldest, Margaret, the youngest. All lived to have families of their own... .&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C111">111</A></SUP><BR>

John was a Loyalist.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C119">119</A></SUP> He is described in &quot;Old United Empire Loyalist List, Appendix B&quot; as &quot;of Marys &amp; Sophiaburg&quot;, S.G. Lieutenant, Indian Department, Interpreter.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C98">98</A></SUP> He joined Butler's Rangers in July 1777, was present at the battle of Oriskany, and was a member of the company of his regiment which accompanied Major Ross on his raid down the Mohawk River in October 1781.  He was with Captain Walter Butler when Butler was killed in October 1781 at the crossing on West Canada Creek. He transferred to the Indian Department as an interpreter shortly thereafter, and was made a Lieutenant and stationed at Fort Oswego, where he was placed in charge of Indian Supply Store. He remained there when the battalion left in August 1783 to re-establish Fort Frontenac to house the influx of Loyalists. In 1786, Fort Oswego was handed over to the Americans, and John and his family left to settle along the Bay of Quinte, on the Front of Fredericksburgh. He drew 1500 acres of land, mostly in Prince Edward County. He mainly lived in Third Township, with periods of residence with his son John on Amherst Island, where he died and was buried.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C111">111</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
John's Claim for Losses as a Loyalist indicates that he was living in Fort Hunter near Schenectady, on a farm with good buildings and a good stock of farm animals. He and his wife had three sons and two daughters. When  the Revolution began, his wife and two small children fled, covering 700 miles on foot.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C111">111</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000f66"><B>Research Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000f66">NAME: His last name is also given as RICHAR.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C113">113</A></SUP><BR>
