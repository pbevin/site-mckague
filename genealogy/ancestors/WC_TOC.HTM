<TD>IMPORTANT: Before you start exploring this tree, PLEASE read the notice on our genealogy page, even if you've read it before--it's been revised. You can get there by going to the bottom of this page and selecting the web address beside the little house. You can also get there from any page in the tree by going to the bottom and choosing &quot;Contact&quot;, which will take you back to the bottom of this page.<BR>

ABOUT OUR ANCESTORS<BR>
<BR>
This tree is mainly for our children, although it may also be useful to others. We'd like them to be able to see what we know of their background--at least on our side of the family--all in one piece. It includes only direct ancestors and some other spouses (and their parents) of direct ancestors.<BR>
<BR>
We've allowed ourselves to be a little credulous with this tree. We've known for a while that we had a lonely branch reaching back into the British royal family, and we decided to explore it--with some amazing results, as you will see from the index. It seems to be pretty reliable, at least back to the Norman conquest of England and somewhat beyond. You can decide for yourselves where to stop believing it.<BR>
<BR>
This is very much a work in progress. We welcome and encourage additions and corrections from members of our family and interested others. We'll be updating frequently, so please come back from time to time.<BR>
<BR>
ABOUT THIS FAMILY TREE<BR>
<BR>
We have chosen to respect privacy by excluding all information about living people except for their names and places in the tree. (We do have a fair bit of such information, and will be happy to help people share it in the right circumstances.) If we aren't sure whether someone is still alive, we have decided to play it safe and exclude the information. If we're reliably informed of the person's death, we'll make the information available.<BR>
<BR>
SOME TIPS ON USING THE TREE<BR>
<BR>
The tree consists of &quot;family cards&quot; and &quot;person sheets&quot;. You can start either by clicking &quot;Home card&quot; above (which will take you to the family card for our parents), or by clicking &quot;Surnames&quot; and picking a surname, and then given name, of your choice, or by clicking &quot;Index&quot; (for this tree ONLY, as many people in it do not have surnames).<BR>
<BR>
Navigation through the family cards is pretty self-evident. What may not be quite so obvious is that you can click on the name of either of a couple on a &quot;family card&quot;, and get a &quot;person sheet&quot; containing more information about that person (if we have it). The information on the person sheet is usually different for husbands and wives, so you may want to look at both. You can then navigate among the person sheets by clicking names. If you want to go back to the family cards, just go to the bottom of the page and click &quot;Web Family Card&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
At the bottom of many person sheets, for the use of those of you who are serious about your genealogy, is a section called &quot;Research Notes&quot;, which contains information about conflicting sources and unanswered questions. Any help appreciated.</TD>
