Elizabeth was small and very agile and could turn handsprings.  Once she was riding a horse through the forest carrying eggs.  An animal frightened the horse and it leapt from under her.  She landed on her feet without breaking an egg.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C23">23</A></SUP><BR>

Elizabeth got forgetful in old age and her mind wandered.  She would ask to go home, forgetting her more than fifty years at Cherry Hill.  If she succeeded in slipping away, neighbours would bring her home.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C6">6</A></SUP><BR>

After her husband's death, she lived with her daughter Sarah and then her daughter-in-law Margaret. She was eventually institutionalized in Whitby ON.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C23">23</A></SUP><BR>

&quot;OBITUARY.<BR>
&quot;The Late Mrs. Wm. McKague.<BR>
     &quot;Another pioneer resident of Hamilton Tp. has been called to her reward in the person of Mrs. Wm. McKague, who passed away in Cobourg on Wednesday week at the great age of 91 years. Mrs. McKague was a most estimable christian lady. She led a strenuous busy life. The wife of one of the pioneer settlers of Hamilton Tp. she proved herself in all things a worthy, proficient and capable help-meet. She settled with her husband on a forest farm in the early days of the colonization of the Tp. It was then not an unusual thing for deer to haunt the woods surrounding the McKague homestead. Here she attended diligently to the duties of her household. Here she cared assiduously for the physical, moral and spiritual welfare of her children, directing them with Godly counsel and example in paths of rectitude, diligence and wisdom. Her she performed her part bravely and capably, not only in attending to the duties of her household and in staunchly seconding the efforts of her worthy husband in securing a home of plenty and comfort for himself and family, but also in performing neighborly acts of kindness, and in helping forward every good cause as she had opportunity. For more than fifty years Mrs. McKague was a faithful member of the Baptist church. For a few years after the enfeebled frame and mind became too infirm for active duty, it was given her to linger on the scene of her earthly activities, until the 'last clear call' came to her and her age-dimmed eyes opened to see the beauties of the Land, just beyond our earthly sight, and she passed to take her place in the Heavenly Home.<BR>
     &quot;Mrs. McKague's maiden name was Elizabeth Coyle. She was born in County of Cavan, Ireland, and when about fourteen years of age came with her parents to this country and settled just north of Baltimore. At the age of eighteen she married Mr. Wm. McKague and with the exception of three years during which they resided near Woodville in Mariposa Tp. her home has been on the McKague homestead in Hamilton Tp.<BR>
     &quot;The funeral took place on Friday afternoon from the residence of her son, Mr. John McKague, to the Methodist burying ground, Baltimore.<BR>
     &quot;The bearers were deceased's sons and sons-in-law. Service was conducted by Rev. R.L. Edwards and Rev. J. Skene.<BR>
     &quot;Mrs. McKague was predeceased by her husband who died Jan. 12, 1888. Of a family of twelve children, nine survive. They are, Robert, Cramahe Tp.; Mrs. John Staples, Grafton; George and Mrs. McLoughlin, Winnipeg; Mrs. Donaldson, Cold Springs; James, Hamilton Tp.; Mrs. Marcus Massey, Morganston; John, Hamilton Tp.; Mrs. Thos. Hoskin, The Gully.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C52">52</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Research Notes</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>BIRTH: Elizabeth's birthdate is also given as 1815,<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C13">13</A></SUP><SUP>,<A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C53">53</A></SUP>  as 1816,<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C64">64</A></SUP> and as ca 1815.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C52">52</A></SUP><SUP>,<A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C6">6</A></SUP><BR>
