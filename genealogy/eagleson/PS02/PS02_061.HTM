<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for Florence Jane STUART</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>In the Castleton area, Florence taught at Red Cloud School and Mount Pleasant School (which Hedley had attended). Florence taught elementary school in Cobourg ON in 1912 or 1913, and had a class of 40 students. Her school choir was chosen to sing for the Prince of Wales's visit to Canada. Later she moved to Peterborough ON, where she was the travelling music and art teacher. When she moved, she took Baden Cochrane [a relative?] with her so he could finish high school.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C49">49</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Florence and Hedley's wedding announcement reads:<BR>
&quot;Miss Florence J. Stuart and James H. McKague announce their marriage on Thursday, the twenty-fifth day of July, nineteen hundred and eighteen, at Zion Methodist Church, Moose Jaw, Sask. At home after Aug. 15th. Ogema, Saskatchewan.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C49">49</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Hedley and Florence had their wedding supper in Moose Jaw at the home of &quot;Uncle Will and Aunt Florence Cochrane&quot;.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C49">49</A></SUP> [It's not clear who this is. Should it be Stuart instead of Cochrane?]<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Florence's dowry contained:<BR>
&quot;2 large figured carpets<BR>
&quot;a piano--Mason &amp; Risch<BR>
&quot;an oak dining room suite<BR>
&quot;an umbrella stand<BR>
&quot;a 12 piece Limoge[s] china set of dishes<BR>
&quot;many cut glass pieces such as a fruit bowl, sugar &amp; cream set on a cut glass tray and other dishes that are antiques today.<BR>
&quot;She brought her framed water colored paintings with her.<BR>
&quot;In the bottom buffet drawer she kept her linen tablecloth and napkins and often displayed herlinen cutwork.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C49">49</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Like Hedley, Florence curled, and her team won awards.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C49">49</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Florence was a census taker twice, the first time by horse and buggy and the second time in their 1929 Model A Ford.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C49">49</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Florence's brother Will built their retirement home in Ogema. The twins were born upstairs because the downstairs was rented to the Martindales. All 300 visitors [in the first month!] had to climb the stairs from the back door. <SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C49">49</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Hedley and Florence came east with the children for a visit in 19?? in their 1929 Model A Ford. Florence built a box with slotted compartments for the dishes. It fit on the running board of the car on the driver's side. They never broke a plate. The driver had to enter from the other side of car. On the passenger side was a huge granny bag for diapers, which had to be washed every night. Florence didn't get to drive on the trip because then Hedley would have had to change diapers. A Manitoba mattress was rolled to fit behind the driver's seat so the babies lay with their feet facing the back and whoever changed the diapers. Stuart usually navigated from the passenger seat while Florence and Dorothy coped with the twins. Theygot caught in Toronto traffic and took six hours to get through the city.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C48">48</A></SUP> <SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C49">49</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Florence got her first washing machine (gas-powered) in 1938. Dorothy bought it from her teaching salary of $400 a year.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C49">49</A></SUP><BR>

Florence wrote this poem:<BR>
&quot;THE WESTERN MOTHER<BR>
<BR>
&quot;To waste in no way must she try, / Or leave the household budget shy. / So she never thought to shirk / A single task of all her work.<BR>
<BR>
 &quot;Soap she made from bacon chips, / Quilts she pieced from rag bag snips. / She ground the dried up parts of bread / For puddings: Sheets upon the bed / Were laid the wrong way up with care / (Except when company was there) / To save the hemstitched tops from wear.<BR>
<BR>
 &quot;The meat she canned, the chickens, too, / The vegetables did the season through. / For fruit used citron, squash and marrow. / She cut old clothes to fit if narrow. / Shirt and aprons from flour sacks / Were worn upon her children's backs. / Paraffin from jellies clear / Was saved and used from year to year. / Made coffee out of barley browned, / When extra cash was not around. / Papers, magazines and string-- / Bottles, boxes, everything / That could be used again, she kept.<BR>
<BR>
 &quot;The floors she covered with rag mats, / Made comforters of woolen bats. / The sheep if passing near the door / Knew by her smile she wished for more. / And even yeast cakes square and yellow / Were made by her and dried till mellow. / Butter, bacon, bread and buns / She made to feed her hungry sons. / Cheese, too, she tried with great success / And spoiled the market in the west. / The picture frames upon the wall, / The vases, flour pots, jugs and all / Were made of salt and other stuff / That looked like they would cost enough. / Mitts and toques were knitted new, / Sweaters, socks and booties too. / Vinegar was brewed in jars. / I tell you what she beat the cars.<BR>
<BR>
 &quot;And once when all the others slept, / She rose--because--the moon was bright / And put her pantry shelves aright. / She could not bear to waste that light. / THE WESTERN MOTHER&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C49">49</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Research Notes</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>NAME: Her first name(s) is/are also given as Florence.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C106">106</A></SUP><BR>
