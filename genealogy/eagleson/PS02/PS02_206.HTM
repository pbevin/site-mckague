<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for Eliezer Emmanuel WOLFE</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>     &quot;Eliezer was a teacher and scholar. During the time of the First World War he drank a poison to avoid having to serve in the Russian army, and was never again in good health. Their village,  Malecz, was captured by the Germans around 1917 and, because he could speak German, Eliezer became an interpreter. He married Freda, the daughter of the local butcher, on Lag B'Omer in  1917. <BR>
     &quot;Their first child, Yaacov (Yankel), died of an ear infection in Warsaw in 1919 or 1920 at the age of one. Following this tragedy, they decided to emigrate to Canada, where Freda's eldest brother Sholom had already achieved some success in business in Toronto.<BR>
     &quot;Zelda, their second child, was born en route, in Warsaw, on New Year's day 1921. Eventually the young family proceeded to Antwerp, from where they boarded a ship to Canada. In the beginning they lived with Sholom, who treated them badly, and they soon moved to a small flat. Eliezer found some work as a peddler and Yiddish teacher, but most immigrants of that period were more <BR>
interested in business than in education, and Eliezer was unable to earn enough to support his family, now including Shmuel, born in 1923. In 1925 or 1926, Freda gave birth to a baby girl, who lived for only three days.  Since Freda was a skilled seamstress, they opened a small ladies'  clothing store, which had some success during the next several years. In 1926 they were able to bring Risha, Emmanuel and Rivka [Eliezer's sister and parents] to Toronto.&quot;<BR>
     &quot;The Great Depression of 1929 wiped out everything that Eliezer and Freda had achieved during the preceding years and, while the family continued to increase, they lived in poverty until Eliezer's death in 1958. Shlomo was born in 1933, Rachel in 1935, Moshe in 1938 and Paltiel in 1940. Zelda and Shmuel had the most difficult time during the 1930s, because they were the ones  who were old enough to understand the meaning of poverty, and what it meant to be treated by the family as the poor relatives. Shmuel, especially, became an active socialist and maintained his integrity to the end of his life.<BR>
     &quot;Eliezer died on Purim, 1958.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C118">118</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Research Notes</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>BIRTH: Eliezer's parentage is confirmed with no birthdate or place given.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C139">139</A></SUP><BR>
