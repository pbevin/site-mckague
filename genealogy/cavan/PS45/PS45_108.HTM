&quot;Dave died on June 18th of a heart attack. We are still in shock!  He had been working in his garden for about an hour (in the heat of the day) when I left to run errands. Two hours later, when I returned, I found him on the bathroom floor. He had apparently come in to rest and watch TV and then went into the bathroom. Apparently, his heart had been weakened by too high blood sugars due to his Diabetes, and the heart was taxed too much. We had traveled to London late April and early May to visit our granddaughter who was there for one semester of college; and, we traveled to Kentucky in early June for the high school graduation of another granddaughter. For these trips, I am indeed thankful. He was cremated, as he requested, and we had an outstanding Memorial Service at our Lutheran Church on June 21st. My three grown children and I will be traveling to Southern California on Labor Day to take some of his ashes to be buried near his Mother and Brother's ashes at the mountain property they all loved.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C632">632</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
