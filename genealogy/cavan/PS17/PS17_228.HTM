<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for George McKAGUE</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Obituary:<BR>
&quot;George McKague, the father of our townsman Robt. M. McKague, at the ripe age of 78 years and 7 months, died at the residence of his son William, near Starr, on Sept. 11, of typhoid dysentery. Mr. McKague is of Irish birth and came to Canada when he was a lad of 12 years, remaining there until about three years ago, when he came here to join his sons. His home has been principally with William, but has lived at times with Joseph of Antelope county and Robert of this place. He was a man of strong constitution and but for the severe attack that caused his death had good prospects for several years yet. A man of Christian character, he leaves behind many warm friends and a relativeship of about 38 in Antelope, Holt and Knox counties who mourn his loss.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C247">247</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
George immigrated to Canada with his parents about 1823.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C6">6</A></SUP> He moved to Irish's Corners (now Woodville) and bought a farm in Mariposa Township about 1837 (east half, Lot 4, Concession 15)<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C30">30</A></SUP><SUP>,<A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C6">6</A></SUP>. His brothers John and Robert did likewise. Price--it's unclear whether it's for a half or whole lot--was £37 10s, paid as $50 and a team of oxen.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C6">6</A></SUP> By 1861 George had moved to Maryborough Township, Wellington County ON;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C30">30</A></SUP> in fact, that was his residence at his marriage to Martha in 1860.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C545">545</A></SUP> In 1875 he was living with his son Robert in Minnesota. No wife appears there.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C244">244</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
A cryptic note listing his wife Susan and his children, apparently in Avon McKague's handwriting, ends: &quot;Neb-Creighton-1879. from Mich, Minn to Neb.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C231">231</A></SUP></FONT><FONT COLOR="#001ecc"></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Research Notes</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>NAME: His last name is also given as McKAIG.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C545">545</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
BIRTH: George's birthdate is also given as ca 1810.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C6">6</A></SUP> He is shown as 51, born in Cavan, Ireland, in 1860.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C545">545</A></SUP> He is shown as 51 in 1861.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C546">546</A></SUP> He is shown on the 1875 census as 66, born in Ireland,<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C244">244</A></SUP> and on the 1885 census as  77, born in Ireland.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C227">227</A></SUP> His son Isaac's death certificate indicates that George was born in Ireland.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C262">262</A></SUP> His place of birth is confirmed with no parentage or date given.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C247">247</A></SUP> His place of birth is also given as NY US.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C547">547</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
MARRIAGE and CHILDREN: Although family lore has it that each of George's wives was the mother of seven children, developing evidence is that they were all children of Susan, with the possible exception of Charles. In fact, Charles may not exist: &quot;I have my doubts about Charles. My grandpa said their was 14 children but the note/list I found in his belongings only list 13 with no Charles. The note was written in the 40's because it said Roy was alive. The letter from Orra lists Charles as one of the children but he says Charles moved to Louisiana and had a son named Robert who moved to Texas. I now believe he is talking about Robert's son Charles Henry. That Charles had a son Robert who moved to Texas.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C242">242</A></SUP>  Some confusion arises from the fact that Isaac's death certificate gives his mother as Martha TOWER, born in New York.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C262">262</A></SUP> The 1880 census entry for Isaac also states that Isaac's mother was born in New York.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C239">239</A></SUP> To further complicate things, Margaret Hill has <B>Isaac</B> McKAGUE &amp; Susan TORVER [TOWER?] married July 7, 1858,<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C54">54</A></SUP> which is the date that Isaac married Sarah ORR.<BR>
<BR>
MISC: George may have been a member of the Northumberland County militia in 1828. The list includes George McKEAG(E), aged 20. Or possibly that is one of his cousins, children of William.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C108">108</A></SUP><SUP>,<A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C104">104</A></SUP><BR>
