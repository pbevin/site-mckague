<BR>
From Grainger family history:<BR>
    &quot;Joe was born in Walkerton, Ont., Feb 22, 1867, the youngest son of Thomas and Jane (Guinn) Grainger. Tom was English and Jane was Irish and Scottish.<BR>
    &quot;Joe came from Oak Lake Man., to the Pleasant Valley district prior to 1891 and worked on farms for awhile, and then returned to marry Ida May McKague at Shilo, Man., on May 13, 1891. Ida was the daughter of Benjamin and Mary Ann (Seeney) McKague, both of Irish and Scottish descent.<BR>
    &quot;Joe and Ida returned to Prince Albert, Sask., and lived there for five years where Joe worked at a laundry and a flour and feed store. While in Prince Albert, Joe and Ida had four children: Herbert, Burton, Alfred and Thomas.<BR>
    &quot;In the spring of 1896 shortly after Tom was born, the family moved to Pleasant Valley to farm. Running a farm was new to Joe and Ida and they had many hardships: losing their hay crop the first year; and making things worse in December 1896 when eighteen-month-old Alfred died.<BR>
    &quot;While in Pleasant Valley, Eva, Gertrude (Gertie), Vernon, William (Bill), Helena (Len) and two sets of twins, Percy and Ida and Almerita and Joe, were born. Both sets of twins died while infants.<BR>
    &quot;In April 1909 Joe and Ida and their family of eight children moved to California, U.S.A., where Joe worked in real estate and farming for about two years until he fell ill with malaria fever. As soon as he recovered from his illness he was on the move again, this time to Victoria, B.C., with another daughter, Beulah, added to the family.<BR>
    &quot;While in Victoria, Joe worked on a tug boat, farmed and gave real estate another try and Ida baked bread every day for a store and Joe delivered it by wheelbarrow. One hundred pounds of flour only lasted two weeks for the family after they moved to McKague--so imagine what it took in Victoria with eleven children and a store. While in Victoria, George, John and Herba were born.  John died at birth.<BR>
    &quot;While still in Victoria, Herb, Burt and Tom joined the army at the outbreak of WWI. Herb was killed while serving overseas in May 1915. Burt served four years and Tom was discharged because they found he had lied about his age. So when the family returned to Melfort, Sask., in 1916 he joined the army along with his dad. After Joe was out of the army the family remained in Melfort where Joe did carpenter work and worked as an undertaker with his brother William.<BR>
    &quot;In 1919 Joe decided to go farming so off they went to McKague, then known as the Craigie district. They started out by car and truck but somewhere along the winding trail near Sylvania they had to transfer the load to team and rack to make the last miles to Herb McKague's. Lena and Beulah remember they were never so homesick before or after as they were when they got to Herb's and Joe was a bit annoyed at anyone being homesick with all the family there.<BR>
    &quot;The first winter, Joe, Ida and eight children lived in a 20'x20' log shack of Jay McKague's. The boy's beds were put on the rafters as there was no room any place else.<BR>
    &quot;In the spring of 1920 the Graingers were on the move again, this time east and a bit north of McKague to the Freshette place, while they built their own house on Tom's place, the W 2-42-14 south of McKague. (This land is now owned by John Duesener). They lived here until the fall of 1928 when Joe was ready to move again, but his moves were getting shorter and they only went east of McKague to the NE 12 42 14 (Now owned by George Chilton) where he built another house which is still standing.<BR>
    &quot;Joe was a good gardener and always grew more than the family could use, so gave a lot of it away as he would not sell his garden stuff. This annoyed the children as they had to pull the weeds and thought it a good way to make a bit of money.<BR>
    &quot;After the family got used to country living they had many good times. George remembers sliding on the hill by the CPR bridge and one of the boys caught his pants on the fence and tore it from the cuff right to the tip, so they used nails to hold his pants together until he could get back home. Some of the things they used to slide on were scoopshovels, pie plates that they were not supposed to have, and anything else that would slide.<BR>
    &quot;The children used to skate on the Barrier River and when old enough went to many dances in McKague, Barford, or Barrier. Lena remembers when living in Barford after she was married, she and Carey pulled up some boards in the step to get a dime she knew was in there so they could buy a can of salmon to make lunch so they could go to a dance in Barford.<BR>
    &quot;In 1939 Joe and Ida moved to Ethelton; by this time their family was all grown and Ida was blind. They were there only a short while and then moved to Melfort to live with their son Vernon. Joe and Ida then went to a nursing home in Prince Albert where they lived until Joe died in 1947. Ida then went to live with her daughter Beulah LaBrash in The Pas, Man., until her death in 1949.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C315">315</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Research Notes</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>BIRTH: Joe's birthdate is also given as Feb 22, 1868.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C207">207</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
