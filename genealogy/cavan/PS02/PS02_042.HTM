&quot;Matthew McKague was born in Ireland, March 19, 1845. He married Essa Sanderson and they immigrated to Ontario where they settled in Guelph. Here Matthew obtained work on the C.N.R. In 1896 he decided to find out what opportunities were like farther west. So bringing his youngest daughter Viola with him, he travelled by train to Winnipeg. Aunt Viola, as a young child, was not very impressed with the muddy streets and the small shacks that the people lived in. So back they went to Ontario to think it over.<BR>
  &quot;Finally the decision was made to move once more. Household effects were loaded into a box car, and this time they came and settled in the Eden district in 1901. Their first home was in a little log shanty two miles north of Eden near the post office. Across corners from them was situated the Methodist Church. Matthew worked on the section gang at Eden for a few years. Then he was transferred to Petrel where he worked in the roundhouse.<BR>
  &quot;In 1909 they moved to Neepawa to be near his daughters, Mrs. Robert Green, who ran a boarding house in Neepawa, and Mrs. John R. Suddaby of Eden.<BR>
  &quot;On May 19, 1914 Matthew died at the age of 69. A year later Essa followed him in May, 1915 at the age of 65 years. The funeral in each case were held from the residence of their daughter, Mrs. Robert Green, 3rd Avenue.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C219">219</A></SUP><SUP>,<A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C220">220</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Research Notes</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>BIRTH: One source gives only Mathew's year of birth,<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C2">2</A></SUP> the other only the place.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C42">42</A></SUP> Mathew's birthdate is confirmed as 1842.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C12">12</A></SUP><SUP>,<A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C10">10</A></SUP> It is also given as 1842/44.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C191">191</A></SUP> He is shown as 27, born in Ontario, in the 1871 census.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C221">221</A></SUP> He is also said to have been born in Ireland on Mar 19, 1845.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C219">219</A></SUP><BR>
