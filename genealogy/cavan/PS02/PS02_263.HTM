Obituary (unknown newspaper, unknown date):<BR>
 &quot;City Pioneer Died at Coast - Mrs. G. H. McKague, Long in Community Work, Passes At Vancouver, B.C. <BR>
 &quot;Following many years of community service in the East and in  Western Canada, Mary Jane McKague, wife of George H. McKague, died in Vancouver,  Wednesday after a lengthy illness. Mr. &amp; Mrs. McKague left Saskatoon for the coast city in November in the hope that a change of climate might be beneficial to Mrs. McKague's health.  <BR>
 &quot;Mrs. McKague was born near Palmerston,  Ont., and was educated in that district. She specialized in music and later became a teacher in a number of the larger centres of Ontario.  Entering the sphere of concert stage, Mrs. McKague played the piano in cities of  the East and West.  <BR>
 &quot;Coming to Winnipeg in 1882, Mrs. McKague continued to make public appearances in musical activities and then undertook to supply music for concert programs and church work in the settlements to the west of the new city of Winnipeg. In those early years of pioneering, Mrs.  McKague travelled in winter by team and sleigh and moved a portable organ from one church to another so that the pioneer congregations might have music with  their worship. The family moved westward to Harding,  Man., about 20 miles west of Brandon, and settled there for a time. In 1905 the family moved to Conquest, being the first settlers in that region. In 1913 the family took up residence in Saskatoon, and McKague's Funeral Home was established. Surviving are her widower, at present in Vancouver; and three sons and two daughters. They are:  Percy L in Vancouver; Norman at Outlook, and Harry in Saskatoon; Ethel and Florence in Vancouver.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C320">320</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Research Notes</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>BIRTH: Her date of birth is also given as 1857.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C193">193</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
