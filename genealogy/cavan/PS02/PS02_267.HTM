<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for Sarah Jane McKAGUE</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>&quot;My parents, Robert John and Sarah Jane Suddaby, with their three oldest children, Mabel (May, 1894), and Gordon (1896), moved from Harrison, Ont. in 1897. In 1898 I was born in a little log shack at the back of a  quarter NW of Eden which Papa bought from Moses Law. It was mostly bush with very little cultivated land. Later Papa built a new log house on the other side of the farm nearer the road.<BR>
  &quot;While on the homestead my sister Edith (1901), brother Victor (1908) and sister Evelyn (1910) were born. In the 1903 scarlet fever epidemic my two sisters May and Edith succumbed and are buried in Rosedale Cemetery. The nearest doctor was in Neepawa, 14 miles away, and someone had to drive for him with a horse and buggy and then wait until the doctor returned to take home the necessary medicine. Then during World War I, my older brother Gordon was reported &quot;Missing&quot;.<BR>
  &quot;We attended the Methodist Church which was located on the SE 1/4 of a section two miles north of Eden. We received our mail from the post office run by a Mr. Baxter on the NW corner of the section cornerwise from the church.<BR>
  &quot;In those earlier days, we had one neighbor who lived fairly close, but there was little communication as they were new Canadians who could not speak a work of English.<BR>
  &quot;Easter was a wonderful time in those days. The women, with their sheepskin coats and deep pockets, would come to visit us and shake hands with everyone and then leave us beautifully colored Easter eggs. These eggs are works of art among the Ukrainian people.<BR>
  &quot;In the spring, word would get around that fish were coming up the river. The new settlers passed in the afternoon in droves with their wagons and double boxes for Arden, and would return the next afternoon with their wagons half full of fish. These were salted away for their summer diet. Fruit was plentiful. We loved the high bush cranberries for jelly, jam, catsup and pies (but beware the pits). We would often put them in a nail keg snd keep them covered with cold water until it was cold enough to freeze. Then we would drain off the water and have fresh fruit all winter. Also there were the raspberries which seemed better the year after a fire had swept through the area. We would leave in the morning, spend all day picking raspberries and come home for supper. For noon lunch we had taken some bread and butter and a little sugar with us and made fresh berry sandwiches.<BR>
  &quot;I began my education at the Hillhead School, which was  about two miles away. In winter I remember climbing snowdrifts 12 to 15 feet high on the way to school. Then we moved to Arden for three years when Papa rented a farm just a mile off the ridge, from Mr. Boughton. While there I attended Ridge View School. School and I didn't get along too well so I went to work at housework. I worked for the Walter Wilsons, Dan McFadyens, Egbert Grovers, Chris Walkers and Fletcher Martins.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C326">326</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Research Notes</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>NAME: Her first name(s) is/are also given as Sarah.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C2">2</A></SUP> <SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C9">9</A></SUP> <SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C181">181</A></SUP><BR>
