<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for Myrtle Evelyn McKAGUE</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>From Sharon Proctor:<BR>
I have in hand [Myrtle's] hand-written memories of their childhood  days. The following is an excerpt: &quot; We lived on the farm in the summer and in town [Artland] in the winter. We did live on the  farm for quite awhile in the winter because I remember how cold it was walking 2  1/2 miles to school. At times it was so cold the other kids wouldn't go, only me. I nearly froze to death, but I loved school so much I wouldn't miss a day&quot;.  (Her memoirs indicate that going to school and getting an education was very important to Myrtle, indicating a bright little girl, however, it was not to be). Will send the text or edited portions at a later date, if you wish.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C205">205</A></SUP><BR>

More from Sharon Proctor:<BR>
From Myrtle's memoirs: &quot;Nellie was just a year old when Mamma passed away.  I'll never forget it as long as I live even if I was only five years old. Uncle George McKague had the undertaking parlors in Saskatoon and sent a beautiful casket and a white dress for Mamma.  She had just finished making us all new dresses out of dyed flour sacks.  Minnie and Nellie had the red ones trimmed in blue and Mabel and I had the blue ones trimmed in red and that is what we wore at the funeral.  We all stood on one side of the casket wondering why they were taking Mamma away. The night she died Aunt Hannah [McKague, wife of Francis McKague, younger brother of James Wilson] came and looked after everything.  She [meaning her husband I guess] happened to be working on a B&amp;B gang and they were stationed in Artland.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C205">205</A></SUP>  <BR>

Further from Sharon Proctor:<BR>
Just some more - are you getting tired of  this? Myrtle writes:  <BR>
&quot;[After Mamma died] Several women in the neighbourhood wanted to each take one of us but Papa said no as long as he was able to work and look after us, he would keep us all together and that's  exactly what he did. I don't know how he did it, but every Xmas we all got a doll, candy, nuts, oranges and apples. Papa was just about the best man that ever lived.  He never spanked us but when he said no, that was all there was to it. I always remember every Saturday night, out came the wash tub and we all had our bath and hair washed and we all had long hair. He washed for us and baked cakes and cookies. Papa always made the bread. He had to work away from home quite a bit doing carpentry work, hauling grain, etc., but he always seemed to make it home in time to make the next batch of bread.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C205">205</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
