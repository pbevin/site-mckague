He was a kind and generous man who liked children.  He was &quot;not husky&quot;. He never went to school, and after their marriage his wife taught him to read and write. He became a great reader, though he did not have the keen intelligence of his wife.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C17">17</A></SUP><BR>

John built the first tiled well in Ogema; then relatives went there for water because it was so good.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C90">90</A></SUP> <BR>

Once John happened to see a couple of people together on the road who were later suspected of committing a crime. During the trial, a lawyer tried to get John to say that he had only thought he recognized them. Finally the lawyer asked, &quot;Do you say that you did recognize them?&quot;. John pounded his fist and emphatically said, &quot;I do.&quot; Later another lawyer told John that he could not have had him answer that way for a hundred dollars. John replied that sharpshooting calls for sharpshooters.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C17">17</A></SUP><BR>

Dorothy Evans (who is a McKague, not a McGregor) has warm memories of John: &quot;John Diamond McGregor was the only granddad I ever had.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C91">91</A></SUP><BR>
