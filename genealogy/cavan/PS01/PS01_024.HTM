'W.J. ASH<BR>
     &quot;The community was shocked on Saturday evening, Oct. 5 to hear of the sudden passing of the late William James Ash who passed away at the Ash homestead where he had resided all his life.<BR>
     &quot;Although he had been in good health for some time he was only confined to his bed a few days. He was 73 years aged, and had been a faithful member of the Congregational Church here at the corner, until church union; since then he had been a member of St. Paul's United Church.<BR>
     &quot;He is survived by his sorrowing wife, the former Mabel Hoskin and one son, Clarence. Also a brother, H.S. Ash, Bedford, Iowa, who visited him this summer. A sister, Mrs. Frank Smith (Mary) of Baltimore, predeceased him some years ago.<BR>
     &quot;A short service was held at the late residence, Tuesday afternoon, followed by service in the corner church here at 3 p.m. Rev. P.C. Brown, the pastor, spoke words of sympathy and comfort.<BR>
     &quot;By special request, the favorite hymn of the deceased, 'Jesus, Savour [sic] Pilot Me,' was sung by Mrs. Clifford Timilin and Mrs. C. Minifie with Miss Edith Hoskin at the organ.<BR>
     &quot;The bearers were Messrs. David Dines, Joe Oliver, Arthur Smith, Harold West, Nixon Timilin and Harold Minifie.<BR>
     &quot;The flower bearers were Messrs. Murray McFiggan, Harold Johnston, Harold Taylor, and Ross Timilin.<BR>
     &quot;Interment was in the United Church cemetery north.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C7">7</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Research Notes</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>DEATH: William's death date, except for the year (which is missing), is confirmed in his obituary.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C7">7</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
