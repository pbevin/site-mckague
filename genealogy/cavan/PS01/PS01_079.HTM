&quot;Ethel May Boyd Laid To Rest At Warren<BR>
     &quot;Ethel May Boyd, beloved wife of George R. Boyd, entered into rest at her home at Warren on August 11, in her 68th year. She had been ill for some months, and the fortitude and faith with which she faced the release from suffering, which she knew was near, were an inspiration to those around her.<BR>
     &quot;Mrs. Boyd, who was born in Northumberland County, Ontario, eldest daughter of John and Bertha McGregor, came to Winnipeg at the time of her marriage in 1889 [sic]. Twenty-eight years ago Mr. and Mrs. Boyd came to the farm at Warren, where they have since made their home.<BR>
     &quot;Beside the sorrowing husband, there are left to mourn her loss, a daughter, Mrs. Bertha Jamieson; a granddaughter, Mrs. John Manchester; and two great grand-children, Linda and John Manchester. Also surviving are two sisters and two brothers. A sister, Mrs. John McKague, of Ontario, and both brothers, G.P. McGregor, of Winnipeg, and W.B. McGregor, of Langley Prairie, B.C. visited Mrs. Boyd recently. Another sister, Mrs. George Bowen, lives at Warkworth, Ontario.<BR>
     &quot;Funeral services were held in Warren United Church and at the graveside in Warren cemetery on Tuesday, August 13. Rev. J. Wiznuk officiated.<BR>
     &quot;Mrs. J.E. Riddell presided at the organ, and accompanied the soloist, Mrs. George Kelsey, of Winnipeg, a niece of the deceased, who so beautifully sang 'The City Four Square', a favorite with her aunt.<BR>
     &quot;The hymns, Jesus Lover of My Soul, and What a Friend We Have in Jesus, were sung at Mrs. Boyd's request also.<BR>
     &quot;More friends than the church could hold gathered to pay their last respects, and the floral tributes, with their comforting message, were many.<BR>
     &quot;For over a period of nearly 30 years, Mrs. Boyd's ready willingness to assist in every community enterprise, had won for her a high place in the hearts of all whose privilege it was to work with her. Throughout the war she served diligently on the Red Cross committee. She was a member of the Church Board, an ardent worker in the Ladies' Aid, and for many years had been an active member of the Women's Institute.<BR>
     &quot;Her direct, fair-minded judgment will be much missed throughout the community.<BR>
     &quot;Pall-bearers were six of her close neighbors:--Messrs. John Hogg, F. McRae, W.R. McDonnell, D. Hamilton, W.J. Jones and W. Manchester.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C23">23</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Research Notes</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>NAME: Her first names are also given as Ethel M.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C20">20</A></SUP><BR>
