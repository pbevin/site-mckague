<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for Ann McKAGUE</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>&quot;It turns out that no one in my father's generation was aware of what had happened to Ann, and my sister and I assume that (a) [the marriage to James Kelley] must have been her second marriage and that (b) Mr. Brintnell must have died. (Brintnell is a very common name in these parts.) It would appear that perhaps my staunchly Protestant AND Irish ancestors couldn't accept her marriage to a Catholic. In any event, succeeding generations knew absolutely nothing about her. This is especially interesting because the Kelly family lived just down the road from my dad and his siblings and none of the McKagues ever knew they were related. I suspect somehow that Ann may have been simply written out of the family and treated as dead, but we have no way of knowing this.&quot; (Linda van Will)<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C1">1</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
However, according to Richard Kvistbo:<BR>
&quot;You might be interested to know that it was Uncle Clarence who told me about the McKague Kelly marriage and that their tombstone was in Warkworth Cemetery. He seemed quite aware that the Kellys were relatives as well as neighbours.  They were also related on the McGregor side (through the Diamonds I think) according to Aunt Ethel and Uncle Percy.  While Aunt Ethel and Uncle Clarence were aware of the connection, my Mother was not, so it is quite possible that our parents and aunts and uncles who were not as interested in genealogy were oblivious to the connection, but I suspect that our grandparents knew about it.  Mother has told me that when she was growing up her parents were very busy on the farm so didn't spend a lot of time explaining who family connections were.  She said that Grandma lived very much in the present and didn't dwell a lot on the past.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C66">66</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
