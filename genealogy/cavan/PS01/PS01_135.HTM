<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for Leslie Robert Martin CLARK</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Leslie advertised for a &quot;life partner&quot; and Susie answered the ad. She wasn't local. They both wanted to keep to the simple life--perfectly suited to each other. For their last ten years, they were off the farm and lived in a little rundown house in (?) Kelwood or something similar, insulated with haybales around the outside. It was all they &quot;wanted or needed&quot;. Their only trip away from home was to eastern Canada in 198? to meet family members.

Obituary, unknown newspaper, unknown date:<BR>
  &quot;Leslie Robert Martin Clark<BR>
  &quot;Leslie Clark passed away at Neepawa District Memorial Hospital with family at his side on April 18, 1999.<BR>
  &quot;Leslie, son of John and Ida Clark was born June 24, 1914, at Glenella, Manitoba. In 1955 he married Susie Dyck who was his lifetime companion. Together they farmed in the Bellhampton district northeast of Glenella working mainly with livestock. He was a hard working individual who enjoyed the outdoors, gardening and hauling wood. He belonged to the Beef Ring in Glenella for many years and was considered a great neighbour. He often told the story of riding his bicycle to Springhill to help out his cousins at harvest time. A long 48 mile ride in those days.<BR>
  &quot;In 1974 Leslie and Susie retired to Kelwood where he continued his love of gardening and yard work. Leslie was a man of great faith.<BR>
  &quot;Leslie was predeceased by his parents and one sister Beatrice.<BR>
  &quot;He will be sadly missed by his wife Susie, brother Bruce Clark and sister-in-law Dorothy, niece Lori and husband Earl Melcosky, Tyson and Kylie plus many cousins, nieces and nephews.<BR>
  &quot;The funeral service was held April 20, 1999, at 3:00 p.m. in Neepawa United Church with Rev. Colin Grambo officiating. Interment followed at Riverside Cemetery.<BR>
  &quot;Pallbearers were David Clark, Earl Melcasky [sic], Joe Poncsak, Stuart McKague, Dwayne Crandall and Frank Ginter. Ushers were Bob and Bev Finlayson.<BR>
  &quot;If friends so desire memorial donations may be made to Kelwood United Church or Neepawa District Palliative Care.<BR>
  &quot;'To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.'&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C79">79</A></SUP><BR>
