<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for Charles Stanley FREED</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2> &quot;Charles was born at Miniota January 22, 1884, the eldest son of Sarah Jane and John Freed.<BR>
  &quot;When Charles was four his dad was accidentally killed when a threshing machine separator tipped over smothering him in the snow. His mother rented the farm and moved to Eden district in 1888.<BR>
  &quot;When Charles became old enough to attend school, he started to go to North End School #465 on the Grover farm SE corner of the N 1/2 of section 3-17-15. Later he attended Hillhead School. One of this teachers was Blanche Scott. The school trustees at the end of December, 1900 were J. Smith, Samuel Currie and Fletcher Martin. As Charles became a little older he was only able to attend school during the winter, and was given a little spending money for starting the school fire every morning. During the summer months he helped on the homestead. He finally had to stop attending school just when he was ready to study 'Euclid'.<BR>
  &quot;One of his home duties was to go for the cattle for miles barefooted through the bush in search of them. There was always the off chance of meeting a bear face to face. On one occasion the dogs did corner a bear. John Elliot, who was an expert shot with a gun, was sent for and he quickly ended that bear's life.<BR>
  &quot;As soon as Charles was old enough to work out for hire to other farmers, he did so. In this way he was able to earn enough to buy horses and a breaking plough with which to break more land on his Mother's homestead. He sold cordwood off the property to also help pay for more machinery. Finally he was able to buy the quarter section west of his mother's and then he had a half section of land. One of his duties when fall came was to take a wagon full of wheat to the grist mill in Neepawa to be made into flour, bran and shorts.<BR>
  &quot;Charles married Adalena Suddaby in 1921. On NE 32-15-16 and in the same yard as his Mother's home, he built himself a new home. In this home four of his children were born:<BR>
  &quot;Edith Dorothy, March, 4, 1923; John Stanley Martin, February 19, 1927; Sarah Elizabeth, September 18, 1932; Robert Argyle, July 10, 1938; Patricia Adalena, October 27, 1944 was born in the Neepawa Hospital. Dr. Bugg of Eden delivered all the babies.<BR>
  &quot;Times became tough on the farmers in the 1930's and the municipalities offered them a way to pay their taxes. One way was by statute labor. Each farmer was required to do a few days work on the road passing by his farm. A group of farmers would work together to grade the road and put in culverts to help drain the water away from the road. In return the wages were credited to their taxes. School taxes were paid by each farmer taking a week in turn to drive the van with his own team of horses.<BR>
  &quot;During the winter of 1933-34 Charles became seriously ill with double pneumonia. His wife nursed him at home with Dr. Bugg making several calls.<BR>
  &quot;In 1941 he sold his farm and the family first moved into the village of Eden and then to Neepawa.<BR>
  &quot;On July 12, 1943 he obtained a job in the Neepawa Salt Plant as a loader in the shipping department at 35 cents an hour. After five years of service he was retired from his last occupation in the plant as a press mixer at age 65, on June 30, 1949.<BR>
  &quot;Retirement is not easy after years of manual labor. So it was with Charles. He went back to work. First on the mink ranch, then the hydro, then the golf course and finally helped at the cemetery.<BR>
  &quot;Low blood pressure caused him to take things easier in the later part of his life. After several strokes he passed away in Neepawa Hospital, March 22, 1967, at age 83.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C219">219</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Research Notes</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>NAME: His first name(s) is/are also given as Charles.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C326">326</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
