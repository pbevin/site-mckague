<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for Elizabeth McFARLANE</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>&quot;The year was 1933 when Grandma came to live in Eden. She had just become Mrs. Fletcher Martin and they lived in a little cottage across from Dr. Bugg's office. She was 65 years of age, with most of her active years already behind her. Her story had begun far from the little village in Belfast, Ireland. She came from a relatively large family, but while only a little girl was left an orphan. She was taken in by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Strain, who were shortly to immigrate to Canada. They settled in the area between Neepawa and Minnedosa.<BR>
  &quot;She met and married Isaac Freed and while still only 18 had the first of nine children.<BR>
  &quot;During the next several years my grandparents pioneered in the districts of Springhill, Glencairn adn Freedale. While at Glencairn the seventh child was born, Cecil Allen, my father. Shortly after the family moved north of Ste. Rose, which was opening up for homesteading. Always resourceful, Grandma applied  for a post office. It was called Freedale, and shortly she followed this up with a small store. The mail and supplies for the store were teamed in from Ochre River. Grandma's was the stopping place for the rare visits in the area of the doctor or mountie.<BR>
  &quot;The last of her children was born at Freedale. My grandparents shared the joys and sorrows of all large families. Two sons served in World War I and although both returned, one suffered the remainder of his life from the gassing he received, while the other son, ironically, lost his life in a hydro accident soon after his return from overseas. Another son died at Ninette. Their elder daughter left two very yung sons when an asthma attack claimed her life. When their youngest son reached high school, Grandma decided to move to Portage where he could continue his studies. Some years later Grandad passed away and Grandma continued to work at the Manitoba School until she married Grandad Martin.<BR>
  &quot;Life in a small town is varied and Grandma took an active interest in several groups. Her first love was the church. She especially enjoyed Sunday School. My fondest memory of Grandma, her snowy white hair in rag curlers, preparing the lesson for her Adult Bible Class. Other groups she joined were the W.M.S., the W.A. and the M.F.U. If  she were with us today, I'm sure Grandma would be interested in the women's movement. She used to remark that it seemed most acceptable that the men folk could spend their evenings relaxing, but she and her aunt were expected to do something useful, such as knitting scratchy woolies.<BR>
  &quot;With the years her health deteriorated and she was forced to give up her interests. She was fortunate to have many good friends and looked forward to their visits.<BR>
  &quot;I realize now that she missed her family. While by today's standards, none of them were far away, it was not customary, even in the 30's and early 40's to travel, so she rarely saw any of them. Aunt Lil Martin and Aunt Ada Freed were regular visitors. Her heart condition kept her shut in and in March, 1945, Grandma passed on.<BR>
  &quot;A service was held in Eden United Church and then she was brought to Portage. Grandma's final resting place is beside Grandad Freed in the Hillside Cemetery, Portage.<BR>
  &quot;The little orphan from Belfast had met life head on and had experience most of life's joys and sorrows. Today she would, if she were here, rejoice in her great-great grandchildren, some of whom are scattered in every direction, but south. With her sense of courage and adventure, I'm sure she would be pleased.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C769">769</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Research Notes</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>MARRIAGE: Her marriage to Fletcher is confirmed with no date given.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C219">219</A></SUP><BR>
