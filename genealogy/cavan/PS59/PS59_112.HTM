<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for Petra Jorgene FLATHAUG</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>From Sharon Proctor:<BR>
Something that was given to me after my mother's sister death about 9 years ago, that came from their mother, Petra Hushagen (nee Flathaug), was a linen tea cloth that according to the note Grandma Hush left inside said she started embroidering it in 1914, and in 1965 her daughter, my mother, Doris Proctor finished it  for her before she died (Oct. 31st). Grandma may have thought it was finished, and perhaps so did my mother, however, it is not. It needs more embroidery stitches and a hem. So, now it is up to me to finish something that was started that long ago. I know exactly what happened, 1914 was the year that Grandma and Grandpa Hushagen were married, and this was when she started to embroider the cloth, however, babies etc. came along, and soon there was no time for such frivolities. Later in life when perhaps she had the luxury of time, she did not have eyesight (she went clinically blind from diabetes). My guess is that my mother always thought that someday her filial duty would be to finish the teacloth for Grandma, however, someday came much sooner than expected, and knowing she was dying (from breast cancer) she worked on it, as sick and as shakey as she was, as an unfinished task of life.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C205">205</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
