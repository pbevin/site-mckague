<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for William McKAGUE</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>William McKeage, who may have been from the US, lived in Ernesttown Township, Lennox &amp; Addington Cos. near Kingston ON in the 1790s and later (about 1808) settled on Cherry Hill Farm near Baltimore ON. His wife Mary Parr was listed in the Vermont census of 1790.  William and Mary are believed to have had a great many children, about whom we have virtually no information.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C30">30</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
The Order in Council for the Free Grant of Cherry Hill Farm to William McKeage of Ernestown was dated Sep 1, 1797. It was awarded on the basis of &quot;settler&quot;.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C205">205</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
Our evidence that John and William were brothers is from the land records of  Northumberland County, District of Newcastle. William transferred Cherry Hill Farm to his son John on Dec 15, 1819 for £25, and John then transferred it to his uncle John on Dec 1, 1827 for £62 10s.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C104">104</A></SUP><BR>

BIRTH: William's parentage (i.e., that he was John's brother) is confirmed with no place given.<BR>
  &quot;My conclusion that William McKeage and John McKague are brothers is taken from the land records of two transactions. The first one by William to his son John and the second one by John to his uncle John.  Here is a transcription of the first part of the two deeds:<BR>
