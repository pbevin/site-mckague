The following information from Lee McKague doesn't quite fit with the information we're really sure of. This needs some investigation:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Grandpa did not seem to want to talk about his past or his heritage. Whereas I got lots and lots of detailed information from my Grandmother about her heritage, Grandpa generally refused to talk about his. I do recall him mentioning that he had several half brothers. Names I had made a record of were Carl, Wilbur J., Ora Wilson, and George. A couple of them, Carl and another I don't recall, had moved to Los Angeles in the thirties or forties.<BR>
&quot;It may be, Carla, that I am incorrect about Ora Wilson being Grandpa's half brother; memories of those conversations with Grandpa are now over 40 years old. Perhaps Ora was an uncle or some other relation to Grandpa. Unless the Ora you referred to had a son also named Ora, I feel sure we are talking about the same person. Given that the Ora you refer to was writing letters in 1941, I doubt that Grandpa was referring to a different Ora.<BR>
&quot;Grandpa did say that his Father's name was Robert and that the family had come from Canada and that at one point they had lived in Iowa.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C695">695</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
