<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for Thomas Sadler WILLIAMS</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Thomas was a member of Lindsay Lodge No. 100, and his funeral was conducted by the Lodge, preceded by the town band.<BR>
<BR>
In part his obituary reads: &quot; [In 1863] at  the request of his Uncle Thomas Sadler, Esq., he came  to Lindsay to learn the milling business, and with the exception of two years which he and Jabez Barnard as partners, spent in the milling busines at Nissouri the deceased has been a constant resident of this town. In 1873 Mr. Williams returned to his old home and on the 12th of August in that year married Miss Margaret Jane Tait [sic], of Ormstown, whose lot it is now, together with five sons and one daughter to mourn the great loss of a devoted husband and fond father. The deceased was a social favourite, an honest, enterprising and patriotic citizen; serving at the Council for several terms as 1st deputy reeve of the town; a member of the fire company, and performing on several occasions, fearless duties at the risk of his own life. Mr. Williams was a member of the 45 Batallion, which was under the command of Major Sam Hughes at the time of the riot in Cobourg in 1871. Mr. Hughes tells of a missile being hurled and it striking Sergeant Williams on the head and knocking him down, but, that nothing daunted he firmly stood his ground. As a member in good standing in the following  societies the deceased will long be remembered:- - I.O.O.F., and Encampment, Home Circle, Royal Arcanium and A.O.U.W. The  funeral on Monday was conducted by the I.O.O.F., who marched in procession headed by the band with a select production of appropriate music, and as the solemn cortege slowly marched from the family residence on Ridout  Street to Lindsay Street, many places of business were closed and hundreds of townspeople congregated to witness one of the largest funerals Lindsay  has seen. The remains were interred at the Riverside cemetery. The sermon  in the Cambridge Street Methodist church next Sunday morning will have reference to the life of the deceased Thomas Sadler Williams.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C767">767</A></SUP><BR>

Another clipping, quoted in part: &quot;...late head miller at Messrs. Sadler, Dundas and Co.'s mills. The deceased had been so long and so favourably  known in that position, the duties of which brought him into contact with such a large circle of the business men and farming community, that his death has caused widespread expression of regret.....had ben connected  with the mill, and it is safe to say that few servants have been more deservedly appreciated by their employer, or esteemed and trusted by the public.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C767">767</A></SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
