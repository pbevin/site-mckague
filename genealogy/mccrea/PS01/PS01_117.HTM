&quot;Three Generations of Medical Practice in Warkworth 1860-1926<BR>
 .....<BR>
&quot;Dr. J.N. McCrea 1819-1891<BR>
     &quot;In the latter aprt [sic] of the 18th century, following the Americam [sic] War of Independence of 1776, two young Loyalist families, the McCreas and the Knapps, left New York State. They were harrassed [sic] and robbed of their possessions by recently discharged American soldiers. They settled at Merrickville in Grenville County, Ontario. Here Edward McCrea met and married Margaret Knapp. During the rebellion of 1837 and 1838 Edward McCrea served in the Patriot's [sic] Army.<BR>
     &quot;There were four children of this marriage--James, Amos, William and Mary. William lived in Peterborough, and I have no information about Mary beyond the date of her birth in 1828. Amos became a medical doctor, graduating in 1851. He married Agnes Reid and practised medicine in Roseneath, Hastings, Norwood, Campbellford and Stoney Creek.<BR>
     &quot;James also studied medicine at Victoria College in Cobourg (originally meant to be the present University of Toronto). He served his internship under his brother at Roseneath and five years later moved to Warkworth. He married twice, the first wife being Bessie Bryce, who died at the age of twenty-two. [NOTE: This is incorrect--see Research Notes.] His second wife was Margaret Forbes, daughter of Daniel Forbes and Janet Kennedy, another United Empire Loyalist family who came to Eastern Canada. According to the information I have, one of her sisters was married to Moses Linton of the Campbellford area.<BR>
      &quot;James McCrea and Margaret had two children--Ezra Sanford, a cripple who died in 1870 at the age of 14 and Margaret, who married Nicholas Dennis Richards. She died in 1897 at the age of 39. Dr. James McCrea died in 1891 at the age of 72. He had relinquished his practice in Warkworth to his son-in-law, Dr. N.D. Richards and had moved to Campbellford to practice [sic] for a number of years, before returning to Warkworth where he died.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C18">18</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
James served in the 1837 Upper Canada Rebellion as a Lieutenant in father's regiment. He took part in the &quot;Battle of the Windmill&quot;. Politically he was a Reformer.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C33">33</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Research Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#660000">NAME: His first name(s) is/are also given as James.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C35">35</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
BIRTH: James is shown as 51 in the 1871 census.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C31">31</A></SUP> His parentage is confirmed with no birthdate or place given.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C35">35</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
MARRIAGE: One source shows James as having a first wife, Bessie BRYCE.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C5">5</A></SUP> However, it appears that this is an error, and that Bessie was in fact married to James Reid McCREA, this James's nephew.<BR>
<BR>
BURIAL: We have a stray note--don't know the source--that says he was buried in Baltimore at the Methodist Burying Ground. I think it's an error.<BR>
<BR>
MISC: James is shown as a Unitarian in the 1871 census,<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C31">31</A></SUP> and as a Presbyterian in his obituary.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C33">33</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
