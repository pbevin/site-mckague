<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Notes for Thomas McCREA</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#660000">&quot;Thomas McCrea lived all of his life on his farm in Montague Township across the Rideau River from Merrickville, Ontario, where he died on March 30, 1863 at the age of eighty-three. He was highly esteemed and trusted by his neighbors and family. In 1840 he was appointed a captain of the 3rd Regiment of Grenville Militia, and later served as an ensign of a flank company of the 2nd Regiment of Grenville.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A DISAPPOINTMENT<BR>
&quot;The following was related by the late Thomas McCrea, of the Rideau; the story is given in his own words: -<BR>
 'The whole of the inhabitants, for miles around, had gathered to raise a log house; at that time it took three or four days to complete the undertaking, men being very scarce. On the third day, after the last log had placed in position, a council was held, and, after due deliberation and much discussion, it was decided that the settlement had so far advanced in civilization that some of the luxuries of life should be procured. Our grist mill consisted of the primitive stump and pestle, the meal when ground being eaten from wooden bowls with wooden spoons. It was decided by the council that I should take one and a-half bushels of wheat, carry it from the site of Merrickville to Brockville, exchange it for one dozen bowls, one dozen iron spoons, the balance to be expended in groceries. With the bag on my back I started for Brockville, before the sun was up, the road consisting of a winding path through the woods, with marks on the trees to show the direction. During my journey I was buoyed with the thought of the great surprise which was in store for our good wives, as the matter had been kept a profound secret from them. Never did a minister go out to preach the gospel feeling a greater responsibility than I felt resting upon myself. I arrived at Brockville on the evening of the second day, pretty tired, and the next day I exchanged my wheat for a dozen white bowls with a blue edge and one dozen iron spoons bright as silver, half a pound of cheap tea and the balance in fine combs and little things for the children. Early next morning, with a light heart, and carefully guarding my precious load, I started for home. I arrived at North Augusta in the evening, and when crossing the stream at that place, on a log, the bark gave away and down I fell, some ten feet on the stones below, and horror of horrors, broke every one of my bowls. Never, never in all my life, did I experience such a feeling of utter desolation. How to go home and meet the expectant people, without the bowls, was an ordeal my soul shrank from, but there was no help for it. I spent a sleepless night on my bed of hemlock boughs, and in the morning proceeded on my way with a sad heart. I found a few of the neighbours at my shanty waiting for me, and was greatly relieved when I saw that the loss was endured with christian fortitude.'&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C99">99</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Research Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#660000">BIRTH: His parentage and birthdate are confirmed with the place given as near Stillwater NY.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C32">32</A></SUP><BR>
