&quot;Joseph Knapp was a United Empire Loyalist during the Revolution.  He emigrated from England to Albany Co., NY and removed to Canada at the close of the revolution. He was a Sergeant in the U.E. Loyal Rangers. He acquired a patent of land grant by the Crown in the Township of Augusta, Lot 5, W Side, 109 Acres, &amp; Lot 7, E 1-2, Ing.7 in 6 , &amp; pt 5 in 1, 409 Acres, on July 15th, 1797.

&quot;William Scott experienced many trials and privations in getting to Canada. The party, consisting of himself, two brothers, and Joseph Knapp, were lost in the woods, and running out of provisions, they were compelled to kill their dogs, which were eaten. Becoming so weak that they were unable to walk, they crawled for three days on their hands and knees. Knapp being completely exhausted, laid down to die, but his companions kept on, and finally reached the settlement of Augusta. Men went to the rescue of Knapp, and they were compelled to tie a blanket on two poles, and carry him to the nearest house.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C114">114</A></SUP><BR>

Death Notices of Ontario, <U>Correspondent &amp; Advocate</U>, Toronto, 1834--1837<BR>
&quot;13 July 1836--At his residence in Montague, on Friday, May 27th, at the age of 93 years, Joseph KNAPP. The deceased was one of those brave U.E. Loyalists who sacrificed his property and risked his life, by taking up arms in defence of his King and country in the American Revolution. He was one of the earliest settlers in this province; did his duty as an officer in the late American War, raised 15 children, all living; had 67 grandchildren, 63 great-grandchildren, great-grandchildren's children 2, all living. He was a member of the Methodist Church for nearly 50 years.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C48">48</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#660000"><B>Research Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#660000">GENERAL: &quot;Much of the information contained within this writing is that of possibilities, and conjecture. As no in-depth research has been done in Westchester Co, NY, as applies to this family, one can only rely on information that has been shared with others researching the same family line.  <BR>
  &quot;That Amos Knapp, son of Timothy Knapp, Jr. and with a known son, Joseph, born 1743, is the correct ancestry for JOSEPH KNAPP - UEL, remains to be proven, though all conjectured information to this point leads toward a 'high probability' that the assignment is correctly stated.  As such, the TEMPORARY information reflected in this report is entered bearing all aforementioned comments in mind, AND THAT THE ANCESTRY IS THAT OF CONJECTURE ONLY AND HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C49">49</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
 &quot;After several years I am a little closer [I hope] to possibly identifying the parents of Joseph Knapp [UEL], though much effort will still have to be expanded to prove that Amos &amp; Elizabeth (?????) Knapp, are his parents, thus this message.<BR>
  &quot;Within the scope of my ongoing research, I have come across the 'Abstracts of Unrecorded Wills, prior to 1790', which depicts an Abstract of the Will of Amos Knapp, dated 17 Mar 1752. The Abstracted Will, indicates a wife, Elizabeth [surname unknown], a son, Joseph, and a daughter, Syil. It also mentions Amos's brothers, Gabriel and Daniel, as Executors, and witnessed by Timothy and Jacob Carpenter. The Carpenter's have a connection of some degree to the Knapps of Westchester Co, NY, and also in Canada. The Abstract is of little value in establishing that the mentioned Joseph was in fact, Joseph Knapp [UEL], but does reveal some possibilities.  Also, the given names Amos, Joseph and Sybil, appear in some of the descendants families, an indication of a possible connection.<BR>
  &quot;As the Westchester Co, NY, records have not been given an in-depth search, nor fully published in other sources, the search could well end up in a search for the 'proverbial needle in a haystack', but I am willing to give it a shot.<BR>
  &quot;As you know Joseph Knapp's [UEL] Obituary, indicates a year of birth as 1743. I surmise that Joseph Knapp [UEL], was probably born at Rye, Westchester Co, NY, rather than the current claims that he was born in England or New Jersey.  As this is conjecture at this point, it is possible!!!  He would have been aged about 9, at the demise of his father, Amos, if this theory is proven correct. While this info at present is very limited, it does open another avenue of possibilities in establishing the ancestry.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C122">122</A></SUP><BR>
