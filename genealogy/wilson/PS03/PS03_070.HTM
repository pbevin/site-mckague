Obituary from <U>Christian Guardian</U>  (R.M. Pope):<BR>
  &quot;[Alexander] was of U.E. Loyalist descent, and belonged to a family remarkable for their attachment to Methodism. His grandfather, Nicholas Peterson, fought in the American Revolutionary War, and at it's [sic] end settled in the township of Adolphustown where he became the father of nine sons and four daughters, all of whom were connected with the Methodist Church.<BR>
   &quot;James Peterson, one of the nine sons, and father of the deceased, was for many years a very useful case-leader [?] and local preacher. He had five sons and two daughters, and to him it was a source of joy to see them all converted and in union with the Methodist Church.<BR>
  &quot;Alexander, the eldest son, was born in Ameliasburgh December 1st, 1819. He was twice married, first to a Miss Laura A. Walt, who was the mother of one son and two daughters. His second wife was Miss Ann Pettingill, who had two sons and one daughter; all his children survive him to be a comfort to his sorrowing widow. He resided some years in the township of Percy, where he was a successful farmer, and in 1878, he removed to Colborne. By strict attention to business and economy he acquired considerable wealth.<BR>
   &quot;He was converted in early youth and became an ardent Methodist. Whatever he did was done heartily as he was a man of warm temperament and strong convictions, and though his impulses may have sometimes led him astray, no one could question his love for his fellows or his attachment to his Church, in which he held official relations both in Colborne and in Percy. In the latter place for a long period, he was recording steward.<BR>
  &quot;His departure to a better land was very sudden, preceded by heart failure, a few hours of conscious existence, in which he gave expression to his faith in Christ. He was visited by Rev. Mr. Howard, who found him calmly trusting in the merits of his Saviour, and pouring out his soul in fervent prayer for his family, between whom the strongest affection existed, as he passed away to be forever with the Lord on September 12th, 1891. The funeral service was conducted by the writer, assisted by Rev. Howard. A long procession of relatives and friends followed his remains to Salem Cemetery, Cramahe Twp, Northumberland Co. ON Canada, where they were interred.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C91">91</A></SUP><BR>

<BR>
Memoir, also from <U>Christian Guardian</U> (?)<BR>
  &quot;The late A.F. Peterson was a grandson of Nicholas Peterson, a U.E. Loyalist, who fought in the American Revolutionary War, on the losing side, and had, at the close of the great contest, to seek a home beyond the limits of the successful Republic; which home, through much toil and patient endurance of many privations, he obtained in the township of Adolphustown, on the Bay of Quinte, where as a reward for his loyalty, he obtained a large grant of land. Here, in his new home he became the father of nine sons and four daughters, all of whom lived to adult age and many of them to be very old.<BR>
  &quot;These children,--and it may also be said of their descendants,--were remarkable for their attachment to the Methodist Church, and their liberal political principles, one of the sons (Paul) being a member of Parliament, in that assembly which the Family Compact in derision called the 'Saddlebags Parliament' on account of the large number of Methodists embraced in it, but which Parliament gave the first blow that led to the defeat of the compact.<BR>
  &quot;The subject of this memoir was born in Adolphustown on December 1st, 1819, his father being one of the nine sons mentioned above. When he came to manhood, he married Miss Laura A. Walt, who became in time the mother of three children, a son and two daughters, and who died at an early age. His second wife was Miss Ann Pettingill, who is also mother of three chldren, two sons and a daughter, and who with the six children survive, to mourn his loss.<BR>
  &quot;In 1850, he removed from Consecon, where he had resided for some years, to the township of Percy, where he was a very successful farmer.<BR>
  &quot;In 1878 he came to Colborne, and for some years was engaged in mercantile business, then retired, having through patient industry and economy acquired considerable wealth.<BR>
  &quot;Mr. Peterson followed closely the traditions of the family and his ancestors. In politics he was a steadfast and active Reformer, and in his religious life was an ardent Methodist. In fact whatever he did, he did it heartily, for he was a man of strong convictions and warm temperament, and though his strong impulses may sometimes have led him astray, yet no one could question the sincerity of his love for his Church, and his Saviour, and, if ever a Christian rejoiced in the services of the sanctuary, he did. He had filled, at different periods, almost every office to which a layman is eligible in the Methodist Church.<BR>
  &quot;The ties of affection which united him with his family were unusually strong, and his children added unbounded confidence in their father to their deep love for him, and he was truly their head in all things. Of the family, two reside in Chicago, two in Percy, and two in Colborne, of whom M.H. Peterson of 'Kellwood' gives promise of being a most successful businessman, as well as being remarked for his kindness of disposition and liberality of actions. The youngest daughter, unmarried, is happily spared to console her mother in this sudden bereavement. His departure to the better land was a brief call,--Heart Failure,--a few hours of conscious but painless lingering, during which he gave expression of unshaken faith in his Redeemer, and passed away to be forever with the Lord.<BR>
  &quot;The funeral services were conducted at the residence by Rev. R.M. Pope, assisted by Rev. Messrs. Howard, Duncan, Hughes and Dowling. A long procession of friends and acquaintances followed his remains to Salem Cemetery&quot;.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C94">94</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#380066"><B>Research Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#380066">BIRTH: His birthplace is given in one obituary as Ameliasburgh.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C91">91</A></SUP><BR>
