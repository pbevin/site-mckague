Parts are illegible or very difficult to read, as they have been &quot;cross-written&quot;--beginning to write as usual, then turning the page ninety degrees and writing across the first layer. (This was a common practice to save paper). But they certainly make one want to know the rest of the story.<BR>

Letter from Lydia (last name unknown) dated Dec 22, 1863:<BR>
&quot;Decber 22nd, 1863<BR>
&quot;My dear Joe<BR>
&quot;I received your letter last night and hasten to reply. I thought it a long time comin' and [illegible] been anxiously expecting it for sometime. You must be content with a very short one just now as I am going out [illegible] with my dear aunts and uncle Spencer(?) and uncle Harry with his future wife.<BR>
 &quot;I am <U>very</U> glad to hear you do not go to those low horrid parties. I cannot endure them and I am quite sure I should never go to one of them even at the risk of offending. I mean to associate with very few persons around Dartford I assure you if I ever live amongst them again and I know my own dear Joe would not wish me too. You(?) have sufficient pride for that I could tell by the company you kept but dearest Joe as for getting too proud to have anything to do with Canadians, you are entirely mistaken. I like them too well for that, one <U>especially</U> so pray, don't give your self any [illegible]ness as to that. You will find in the [illegible] whom I come [illegible]. I know I always had pride and what kind of creatures would we be unless we had. The allwise Providence no doubt never intended that you visit unrefined persons, both as [illegible] and education should not(?) associate with each other it's against the law of nature I think everybody should keep their own place to which I always intend to do. We have had beautiful weather I can go this minute and pick a boquet in the open air and a pretty one too. Have you had any sleighing in Canada? Believe me whether it's hot or cold I am obliged to you for sending the letter to my sister &amp; enclose an envelope for you with my likeness, its not a flattering one, its so very dark. I do hope you will get yours taken just to please <U>me</U>. I would like to show some of my friends their future nephew, get it done as hasty as possible in a standing position with a book or something in your hand--they are such particular covies here but do their best they can't make me 'come the guard'. They think I am dreadfully <U>blunt</U>. English ladies are so [illegible]ing would not be seen in a kitchen. One of my uncles tells me I am the only natural unsophisticated girl he has seen. He thinks it is quite refreshing to talk to me. I go to a party most every night and I cannot enjoy myself. I feel so very awkward for fear I might commit myself, do something I should not. My uncle I am staying with at present is going to have a large dinner party tomorrow. I dread it, so many [illegible], first couse we are to have roast beef 2nd roast goose with various other little dishes, Pork to eat with etc. &amp; applesauce 3rd Plum pudding, brandy sauce 4 [illegible] plum and apple pies in deep dishes 5 mince pies &amp; tarts and for dessert wine, champagne, sherry and port with oranges, raisins nuts apples <U>plum</U> cake and minced biscuits. There what do you think of dinner like that I have [illegible] one nearly every day but only have bread &amp; butter for tea. I like the English way of cooking much better than the Canadians, at our parties we never have dancing, people generally go home about ten we have plenty of music all my family have pianos and sing too.<BR>
 &quot;So Maggie Douglass(?) thinks we are going to get married does she. Next to my own sisters I like that girl best and should I ever get married she shall be my bridesmaid or at least one of them, for I mean to the [illegible] and have two now don't laugh and say nonsense. I expect to return next June sometime. I can hardly tell yet as for my legacy is concerned I shall not get any but my friends are going to send me back. I am more sorry on your account than mine as I had intended buying so many little useful things here as they are so much cheaper it would have saved pounds. My friends have been kind &amp; have given me a great many presents but I know that you will not care for that. I should be sorry to think it but it would have been nice if I could get it, however dearest Joe I will try and make a good obedient wife. I cannot do more if this little money affair makes any difference in your sentiments towards me You must let me know and all though it may perhaps cost me a struggle, you shall be free but I am [illegible] of your generous nature to talk some thing dear I never deceived you as regarded my affairs you know as much as I did, likewise that it was a doubtful case whether I should get anything, dearest Joe let me beg of you that if you should meet with any person you like better do not allow one thought of me to cross your mind. I like you too well to cause you unhappiness, write soon [illegible] is a good boy and believe ever <BR>
 &quot;your affectionate Lydia.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C83">83</A></SUP><BR>

Letter from Lydia (last name unknown), unknown date:<BR>
&quot;Warkworth<BR>
&quot;Friday Morning<BR>
&quot;I cannot leave Percy without one more expression of my lasting regret at what was taking place. I assure you that what you attribute to pride, was only my over sensitiveness in fancying you no longer cared for me, if dear Joe you had been more guarded(?) in what you wrote much misery would have been spared us both. As it was when I received your letter I answered it in a spirit more approaching to madness than anything else, and made use of expressions of which I was soon heartily sorry. When your second letter came I was too proud to acknowledge my fault although I plainly saw you were the same Joe of old. As for myself I am perfectly wretched at the thoughts of wounding anyone's feelings, much less those whom I dearly love and respect and to you in spite of appearances I do both.<BR>
 &quot;I do not take all the blame upon myself. I thought your letters cold and constrained. I have been living with persons so warm in their expression of affection that those of the man of my choice seemed forced I was wrong to think so but it it too late now to lament You say 'you are faithful to me altho' at a distance' and so was I, while I was in England I received an offer of marriage from a gentleman possessing three hundred pounds a year and I refused why? because I remembered you. I remembered our sorrowful parting, and thought with joy of our future meeting, where was my pride then?--rather scarce I think--<BR>
 &quot;I never expect to be happy again, at least not till memory of the injustice I have done you is blotted out and when I am an old unmarried woman shall think of the loves of my youth, for Joe I shall never marry. I have made one fatal mistake I shall not make another--Oh Joe, my still dear, dear Joe, do show a little compassion, if I have forfeited your love, still grant forgiveness and oblivion of the past. My punishment is more than I can bear I hear you are coming down here on Sunday. I though it best we should not meet it would be painful for us both I hope you will soon marry, it will heal the wound I thoughtlessly inflicted If you should come to C you shall be received by me as of old<BR>
 &quot;Once more dearest Joe I claim your forgiveness and remember it was my very love for you that made me do as I did. Oh dear Joe think sometimes of the<BR>
 &quot;unhappy Lydia<BR>
 &quot;If any Sunday you should feel inclined to come to C- we should be pleased to have you [illegible] I shall be home till the new year as I intend going to school.<BR>
