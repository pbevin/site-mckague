<U>Oberlin Press</U>, 1945--obituary of Theresa M. McKague:<BR>
  &quot;Theresa McKague, youngest daughter of Robert and Jane McKague, was born near Newtonville, Ontario, Canada, October 14, 1864 and died at the Benton Memorial Hospital Jan. 23, 1945, at age of 80 years, 3 months and 9 days. Her parents had immigrated from Ireland to Canada early in life; had met and  married at Newtonville, and made their home there within sight of Lake Ontario; and in this home their five children were born.<BR>
  &quot;Later the father bought a store in the city of Toronto, to give his children the benefit of better school facilities. In 1878, when the decision was made to move to United States, the eldest of the children, Samuel, lacked a few weeks of completing his college course and of receiving his M.A. degree, and Theresa, the youngest was 13 years old and in her first year of high school.<BR>
  &quot;The family settled at York, Nebraska, and two years later in the early spring the father, Robert, and Samuel McKague walked out to Decatur County and homesteaded land two miles east and eight north of Oberlin, in Sherman Township, and then walked back to their home in York. The next spring the two again walked out to their claims in Decatur county and built a small sod house and soon the entire family were together in their new little home in the west. All of the privations of the early settlers were known to the newcomers. Their people had been well-to-do; they had been used to luxuries; here their house was a soddy; oxen their only means of travel; money was scarce and cornmeal was often their only food. The ill health of the mother added to their difficulties.<BR>
  &quot;The two oldest girls taught school, as did Theresa, as soon  as she was old enough to apply for a certificate. When the older sister, Minnie, married, the younger girls carried on adding their salaries to the family purse to help make their common life more comfortable. Miss Theresa taught for 18 years, all but one term in Decatur County. The school houses were sod with roofs of willow branches and dirt, her salary varied $10, $12, $15 per month, seldom more. She walked from home to school, sometimes nine or ten miles.<BR>
  &quot;The invalid mother longed for her home in Ireland, but thought she would be happy if she coul1 have a home of her own on the Beaver Valley. The children worked hard trying to accomplish this for her. <BR>
  &quot;Crops were poor, living hard, and little money could be saved from their meager salaries. It was 18 years before there was enough money in the bank to buy the home they wanted. Then, just two months before they moved into their new home, the mother died.<BR>
  &quot;The move to the new Beaver Valley homes was in February 1900, two years later the father died, leaving the three children, Samuel, Rachel and Theresa. After Rachel s death in 1924, Samuel and Theresa began planning, 'What would be the best disposition of the property they had accumulated throughout the years of privations, and hard labour. The last of their family, with no other close family ties, they felt that their possessions should be given to a  community project or institution which would bring material benefit to the neighbors and friends of the county which had been their home for a half century. A temple for the Masonic lodge was the result of that wish.<BR>
  &quot;The brother, with first thought for the sister and Companion, gave her the property, to bring comfort and happiness throughout the remaining years of her life, to go on to the lodge for the construction of a temple when she no longer had need of  the property. When her brother died in June 1928 and she was left alone, the thought came to Miss Theresa of what a fine thing it would be to have the temple built while she might witness its planning, its building and  final beauty of the finished structure, to see the dream of her brother become a reality, and to share in the enjoyment which the memorial would bring to the people of the community. So the necessary arrangements were made and now the beautiful temple stands, a fitting memorial to bring her comfort and happiness throughout the remaining years of her life.'<BR>
  &quot;The above paragraph written of Samuel and Theresa McKague at the time of the dedication of the Temple in June, 1932, adequately expresses the reason for its completion at that time. For this past 13 1/2 years Miss Theresa's life has been centered on the welfare of the Temple, and the activities of Oberlin Chapter of the Order of Eastern Star, of which she was a life time member, and of Mountain Slope Lodge of the Masons.  Intensely loyal by nature she made its success her joy, and sorrowed in its partial failures to live up to its highest ideals.<BR>
  &quot;Last October the Eastern Star membership held a party and social evening in honor of Miss McKague's 80th birthday. One of several like occasions when they tried to show to Miss McKague their appreciation of her generosity and interest in the Order.<BR>
  &quot;Truthfully has it been said of Theresa McKague: 'Miss Theresa has built up a p1ace in the affections of the community that can not be easily filled by another. Unassuming, of modest tastes, ever cheerful and thoughtful of others; so she is known to everyone. In her is the peace and contentment that comes always to those who live for the enjoyment they can give to others. And so the Temple stands, a memorial not only to Samuel McKague, who was primarily responsible for its erection, but also to his sister, Miss Theresa McKague, whose entire life has been devoted to the happiness she has been to give to others.'&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C13">13</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Research Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">NAME: Her first names are also given as Threasa J.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C12">12</A></SUP><BR>
