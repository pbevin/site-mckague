<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Notes for Thomas McKAGUE</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;Thomas was the youngest child of Andrew McKague's family and the only child born in Canada (1841). He was seven years old when his father died and his mother disposed of her shares in the family farm and moved in with her son Andrew in his new log home on his farm on Con. 6 East of Culross Twp. (1855).<BR>
  &quot;In 1861 when Andrew married, Thom's mother purchased a small home behind the shops on Clinton St. of Teeswater on the rear of a lot on which the home of William Thompson now stands. Tom took over a tinsmithing business close by facing the market square (from the history of Dr. Gillies). He and all the family possessed creative artistic abilities. Some kitchenware from his shop may still be in use somewhere today.<BR>
  &quot;By 1875 he had married Margaret Bullard, formerly of Stratford, and had built the old Post Office with an apartment above. This is where the family resided before he turned to farming. His first farm, Con. 7 East, Culross, just beyond the old frame schoolhouse. He later moved to the Wroxeter area of Howick Twp. William was born in Teeswater and several other children in each of Culross and Howick Twps. Since the soil was not to his accustomed liking in Culross [?] he left Howick and started again on Lot 18, con. 13 of Culross just west of Salem Corner. He died in 1890 when William the eldest son was only 14 years of age.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C4">4</A></SUP><BR>
