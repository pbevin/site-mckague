<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Notes for Andrew McKAGUE</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;In July, 1837, Andrew and his wife, Mary Johnston, immigrated from the community of Johnston's Hill (1 mile east of the town of Newton-Hamilton in the County of Armagh, Ireland) to Newtonville, Twp. of Clarke, County Durham, on the shore of Lake Ontario in Upper Canada.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C3">3</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
    &quot;In 1832 (or thereabouts) Andrew McKague ... and his wife Mary Johnston ... left Co. Armagh in Ireland and settled in Upper Canada on [the] shore of Lake Ontario near Newtonville (50 miles east of Toronto) in the Township of Clarke, County of Durham.  They took up 100 ac.--the north half of Lot 9 on the Broken Front of Clarke (irregular shore line) being 1/2 lot away from the lake since the south half of same lot fronted on lake. This is directly south of the hamlet of Newtonville and one mile south of Hwy 401 and about the same distance from the lake. The white house now on the north half can be seen from the freeway.<BR>
     &quot;Five children were born in Ireland one (possibly) on the crossing, and three in Canada.  This remains to be verified. The father &amp; older sons succeeded in farming on good land and three of the McKagues married 3 Sharpes, a neighbouring family also out from Ireland.<BR>
     &quot;Andrew McKague died in 1848 and his tombstone in the old small churchyard of the former Presby. Church at Newtonville reads:  'In memory of Andrew McKague, who departed this life, March 31, 1848 aged 70 years, native of Co. Armagh Ireland--died in the faith of the gospel--also Joseph son of the above May 20, 1850 aged 11 years.' His will dated Mar 20, 1848, filed now in the Bowmanville Registry Office shows very interestingly how he provided for his family.  In substance it reads: 'I, Andrew McKague of the Twp. of Clarke, Yeoman ... being weak in body but strong in mind do bequeath ... To my eldest son, Wm, 5 shillings. To my wife Mary, 20 acres (central portion) of N. 1/2 of Lot 9 in the Broken Concession, Twp of Clarke etc for her share and she is to keep my youngest son Thomas. To my second son Robert, 20 ac. N part of N. 1/2 of Lot 9 as his share, he to pay Hugh 20£ by way of his share. To my third son Andrew 20 ac (S part of N 1/2 etc.) as his share, he to pay Joseph 20£ by way of his share. To my fourth son John, 20 ac. (part of E side of N 1/2 of Lot 9) as his share, he to pay daughter Eliz. 20£ by way of her share. To my eldest son Wm 20 ac. part of W side of Lot ... as his share he to pay daughter Margaret Sharpe 20£ by way of her share, etc'. Executors Wm. McKague &amp; John Sharpe (son in law).  Witnesses:  Hugh Sharpe and Robert McKague. In 1852 this will was registered along with the survey measurements necessary for the probate by son Andrew on May 8 (date unclear).<BR>
     &quot;1855 was a year of upheaval for the family. The small acreage left them in Clarke &amp; the nominally free land of the Queen's Beach(?) in Culross of Bruce County lured the sons westward.  John moved first by selling his lot in July 1855 and going to a new home on the Culross-Teesbury (or Huron-Bruce) Boundary between Teeswater &amp; Wingham.  Most of the others followed except Margaret Sharpe and Robert who went to the U.S.A. (sold 20 ac. for $1250). Mary, the mother lived in Teeswater until her death in 1884 and is buried in Teeswater Cemetery.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C1">1</A></SUP></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>Research Notes</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT COLOR="#000000">DEATH: The year of Andrew's death is confirmed with no place given.<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C2">2</A></SUP><BR>
