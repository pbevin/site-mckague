<P>
Thanks to site administrator Pete Bevin, you can now search our site. Just enter your search word or words and click! A warning, though--you may get more hits than you're ready for. You might want to familiarize yourself with the site's structure first.</P>
<P>
 For example, we have a number of family trees (and some people turn up in more than one, often with exactly the same information). If you already know which part of our family you're interested in, you might want to head straight for that tree on our <A HREF="../genealogy/index.html">Genealogy</A> page and search the index.</P>
<P>
Or if you're interested in photographs rather than genealogical information, you can go directly to our <A HREF="../photographs/index.html">Photographs</A> section.</P>

<P>
If you do decide to use the search engine, here are a few tips:</P>


<P>
(1)  You're not limited to names; you can put any word in. For example, you could search "Presbyterian", or "teacher", or "Toronto".</P>


<P>
(2)  Because of a glitch in the program that we haven't been able to correct, if you search a word, you won't find it if it's IMMEDIATELY followed by a footnote number. So if you haven't found what you're looking for using, say, "farmer", try again using "farmer*", which will find any word that STARTS with "farmer", including "farmer" followed by a footnote number.</P>

<P>
Good hunting!!!</P>
