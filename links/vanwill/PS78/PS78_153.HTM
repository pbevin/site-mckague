<TR><TD COLSPAN=3><B>Notes for Lambertus VAN WILL</B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Lambertus studied in Leuven. According to a document dated Sep 21, 1769, there appeared before the aldermen of Beek en Donk &quot;Dielis van Will, miller and inhabitant here, indicat[ing] that his son Lambertus van Will, theologist from the University of Leuven, plans to enter the monastery and therefore needs a title patrimonial by lack of a title Ecclesiatic to be alimentated and supported with money during his life.&quot;<BR>
     &quot; So explained the comparant to adopt like he adopts at the end subject Lambertus van Will, to alimentate and support during his life, by paying each year one hundred and fifty guilders.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="../WC_SRC.HTM#C7">7</A></SUP><BR>

&quot;van Will became assistant in 1775 in Driel, but already on January 24 of the same year he was fined Nlg 500, because he was in Driel without previous permission. For this breach of the law there were several expenses [?fines] with a total of Nlg 68, but as agreed and according to the receipt  Jan 24, 1775 only 51 guilders and 12 nickels were paid. Probably because of nastiness, van Will was moved as curate to Udenhout, but Vicarius Aerts appointed him on Feb 26, 1776 deservitor in Driel, which was also agreed by the Baron of Haaften, official of Bommelerwaard. The same year, on August 4, he was appointed priest. van Will became in 1787 the dean for the district; he died Oct 23, 1806.&quot;</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="100%"><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0">
