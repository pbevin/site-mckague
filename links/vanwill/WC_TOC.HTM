<TD>We've constructed this tree for the van Will family.<BR>
<BR>
This is very much a work in progress. We welcome and encourage additions and corrections from members of the van Will family and interested others.<BR>
<BR>
ABOUT THIS FAMILY TREE<BR>
<BR>
We have chosen to respect privacy by excluding all information about living people except for their names and places in the tree. (We do have a fair bit of such information, and will be happy to help people share it in the right circumstances.) If we aren't sure whether someone is still alive, we have decided to play it safe and exclude the information. If we're reliably informed of the person's death, we'll make the information available.<BR>
<BR>
SOME TIPS ON USING THE TREE<BR>
<BR>
The tree consists of &quot;family cards&quot; and &quot;person sheets&quot;. You can start either by clicking &quot;Home card&quot; above (which will take you to the family card for our first van Will), or by clicking &quot;Surnames&quot; and picking a surname, and then given name, of your choice. We do NOT advise that you start with &quot;Index&quot;, as loading the index is a slow process, and getting there through &quot;Surnames&quot; will be much faster.<BR>
<BR>
Navigation through the family cards is pretty self-evident. What may not be quite so obvious is that you can click on the name of either of a couple on a &quot;family card&quot;, and get a &quot;person sheet&quot; containing more information about that person (if we have it). The information on the person sheet is usually different for husbands and wives, so you may want to look at both. You can then navigate among the person sheets by clicking names. If you want to go back to the family cards, just go to the bottom of the page and click &quot;Web Family Card&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
At the bottom of many person sheets, for the use of those of you who are serious about your genealogy, is a section called &quot;Research Notes&quot;, which contains information about conflicting sources and unanswered questions. Any help appreciated.</TD>
