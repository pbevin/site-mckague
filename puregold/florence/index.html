THE WESTERN MOTHER</P>


<P>
To waste in no way must she try, <BR>
 Or leave the household budget shy. <BR>
So she never thought to shirk<BR>
A single task of all her work.</P>


<P>
Soap she made from bacon chips,<BR>
Quilts she pieced from rag bag snips.<BR>
She ground the dried up parts of bread<BR>
For puddings: Sheets upon the bed<BR>
Were laid the wrong way up with care<BR>
(Except when company was there)<BR>
To save the hemstitched tops from wear.</P>


<P>
The meat she canned, the chickens, too,<BR>
The vegetables did the season through.<BR>
For fruit used citron, squash and marrow.<BR>
She cut old clothes to fit if narrow.<BR>
Shirt and aprons from flour sacks<BR>
Were worn upon her children's backs.<BR>
Paraffin from jellies clear<BR>
Was saved and used from year to year.<BR>
Made coffee out of barley browned,<BR>
When extra cash was not around.<BR>
Papers, magazines and string--<BR>
Bottles, boxes, everything<BR>
That could be used again, she kept.</P>


<P>
The floors she covered with rag mats,<BR>
Made comforters of woolen bats.<BR>
The sheep if passing near the door<BR>
Knew by her smile she wished for more.<BR>
And even yeast cakes square and yellow<BR>
Were made by her and dried till mellow.<BR>
Butter, bacon, bread and buns<BR>
She made to feed her hungry sons.<BR>
Cheese, too, she tried with great success<BR>
And spoiled the market in the west.<BR>
The picture frames upon the wall,<BR>
The vases, flour pots, jugs and all<BR>
Were made of salt and other stuff<BR>
That looked like they would cost enough.<BR>
Mitts and toques were knitted new,<BR>
Sweaters, socks and booties too.<BR>
Vinegar was brewed in jars.<BR>
I tell you what she beat the cars.
</P>

<P>
And once when all the others slept,<BR>
She rose--because--the moon was bright<BR>
And put her pantry shelves aright.<BR>
She could not bear to waste that light.<BR>
THE WESTERN MOTHER.</P>
