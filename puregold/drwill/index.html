<P>
William graduated from medical school (probably Victoria College) in Cobourg ON about 1889. He was a doctor at Frankford ON for several years before his death.  (You can find out more about William in our family tree for the McKagues of County Cavan.)</P>


<P>
During an influenza epidemic shortly before his planned marriage, William was urged by his landlady not to go to a sick patient's home since he was so unwell himself. He insisted on going, contracted pneumonia and died after a week's illness.</P>


<P>
One of his Masonic brethren immortalized him in the following poem, printed in the local newspaper.</P>

<P>
Doctor rest! Thy work is o'er,<BR>
Sleep the sleep that knows no breaking;<BR>
Dream not of thy patients more,<BR>
Days of labor, nights of waking.</P>


<P>
In our trouble strickened town,<BR>
Tears of friends thy couch bedew;<BR>
Never, never will be found<BR>
One so greatly loved as you.</P>


<P>
Christian prayers shall reach thine ear,<BR>
Songs of praise and mournful knells.<BR>
Trump nor prayers can summon here,<BR>
Thee, who with thy Father dwells.</P>


<P>
Doctor! Doctor! thou hast left us,<BR>
All thy toils and cares are o'er,<BR>
In heaven we hope at last to meet thee,<BR>
But on earth, alas! no more.</P>


<P>
Yes the Lord's shrill trump shall call<BR>
All his children to his side,<BR>
Still bright music from his throne,<BR>
Shall ever-more with thee abide.</P>


<P>
Ruder sounds shall not be heard,<BR>
Pains and aches are now unknown,<BR>
Since the good Lord's voice you heard,<BR>
Calling to his Eternal Throne.</P>


<P>
Doctor dear, to mortal man<BR>
Thou wast sent to be a friend.<BR>
Little thought we, so near at hand,<BR>
Thy earthly work should find an end.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>


<P>
Thy death has caused sorrow great,<BR>
But still one joy, with us, remaineth<BR>
To know that at the heavenly gate,<BR>
Thou couldst give the Shibboleth.</P>


<P>
Yes, dear Dr., you have left us,<BR>
From this world of grief and pain.<BR>
This may all our life bereave us,<BR>
But our loss has been your gain.</P>


<P>
Yes, the Lord, He called you hither,<BR>
We have seen you leave our side;<BR>
But in heaven we'll meet each other<BR>
When we, too have crossed the tide.</P>


<P>
Our brother gone! Of course we feel<BR>
It is a sad and heavy stroke;<BR>
Why should we morn? our grief conceal,<BR>
Our brother's left the brightest hope.</P>


<P>
Now brothers, sisters, one and all,<BR>
To your brother's death lend an ear;<BR>
Make haste, be ready at God's call,<BR>
Before His Throne we must appear.</P>


<P>
Soon will our earthly course be run,<BR>
Our mortal frames they must decay;<BR>
Brothers and sisters, one by one<BR>
We'll fade like he and pass away.</P>


<P>
God knows best. He took him home<BR>
To share the joys of heaven there;<BR>
Bravely we'll fight till the victory's won<BR>
And meet our loved brother there.</P>


<P>
A BROTHER</P>
