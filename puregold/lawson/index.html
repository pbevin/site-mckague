<P>
Dear saintly mother, she is growing old,<BR>
The saddest thought in all of life's refrain,<BR>
That thrills me with a loneliness untold,<BR>
For she will not be young and strong again.</P>

<P>
The silver threads have come, and come to stay<BR>
Among the locks of hair that once shone bright.<BR>
The years have dimmed their hue, and left the grey,<BR>
As fades the golden day toward the night.</P>

<P>
And Father Time has touched that brow today<BR>
With lines that tell the story of a life,<BR>
A life not strewn with roses all the way<BR>
But with its ample share of care and strife.</P>

<P>
That sacred head that time is bending low,<BR>
Just as earth's fairest flower must droop and fade<BR>
And sheds its petals, where the young may grow<BR>
The lovelier where her wasted form is laid.</P>

<P>
Those hands that one day cared so well for me,<BR>
When in a strange cold world I helpless lay,<BR>
Are not so certain as they used to be,<BR>
But growing slowly frailer day by day.</P>

<P>
And when we walk together, she and I,<BR>
About the street or in the garden green,<BR>
Her step is not so light as days gone by,<BR>
And slower now than once it may have been.</P>

<P>
Thus slowly, calmly, silently as eve<BR>
Steals down, to bring an end to every day,<BR>
The mantle of the years in hoary weave<BR>
Comes showering down, and fades the glow away.</P>

<P>
It matters not how fair the day has been,<BR>
How perfect is the fragrant rose in bloom,<BR>
The loveliness must wither and decay,<BR>
The fairest day must come to evening gloom.</P>

<P>
It matters not how beautiful the face,<BR>
How radiant the glow of youth and joy,<BR>
The touch of time must alter every grace,<BR>
And blight and change and gradually destroy.</P>

<P>
For time is on the wing and life is brief,<BR>
We do not miss the seasons as they go,<BR>
Until the gentle falling of a leaf<BR>
Reminds us of a winter's frost and snow.</P>

<P>
Perhaps some little kindness we can show,<BR>
May add another day to mother's years,<BR>
To make the day seem brighter here below,<BR>
Some little token spare her many tears.</P>

<P>
If we have any flowers we would give,<BR>
In token of the love we proudly bear<BR>
For her, who cannot always with us live,<BR>
Give her them now while they are fresh and rare.</P>

<P>
When they have laid her silently away,<BR>
And God has claimed the spirit He has given,<BR>
She will not need the flowers of earth's decay,<BR>
She'll have the fairer flowers that bloom in heaven.</P><BR>
